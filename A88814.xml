         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen this Piece is once come into your hands, there needs nothing be ſpoken further, either by way of commendation of the Work, or upon the account of its Dedication to you.

You, whoſe he was, both by your free Choyce, and his moſt willing Service. Moreover, the Subject here preſented, beſides its own uncontroverted Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Neceſsity, which commends it to all, comes ſingularly commended to You upon a double Reſpect; partly, as that which was the largeſt and choyceſt part of his Labours with you; partly, as what of all other was the Vote of his <hi>laſt Bed</hi> to have made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick for your uſe. Had himſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived to have compleated his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as he had began in his weakneſs to reviſe them, the whole ſurely had been more ſemblant and exact: yet as it is, it is his own as he left it; not lame, or torn, though here and there undreſt (eſpecially towards the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) and ſuch as nevertheleſs ſpeaks

a ſufficient worth, even without its due dreſs.</p>

Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God expects of you an exact Hand in this Work, whom he hath grac'd with ſo fair Copies.

            <p>Poſsibly the Work comes forth much later than your deſire and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation; and truly, than ours too: not one or two, but more years having paſs'd ſince the Authors death.

            <p>The little of the Life of Faith amongſt men, and of Faith and Truth in Life, excites us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, though not Midwives to deliver, nor as Nurſes to dreſs, yet as ſtanders by and ſervants to commend this Birth as Legitimate and Lovely.</p>

               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.12.</note>Though we take not upon us to put weapons into thy hand for this good fight of Faith, (<hi>that</hi> this Tract doth) yet if we may but encourage to the uſe of them, like the Drum and Fife, and ſuch inferior Officers, it ſufficeth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.</note>We cannot ſay (as the Apoſtle) in theſe days, <hi>Need we Epiſtles of Commendation to you, or Letters of Commendation from you?</hi> Indeed we do need them both: for our Perſons, Office, Doctrine, all are under the foot of Pride and Ignorance. We love not our Food, and loath our Phyſick, and (at the beſt) give entertainment to the moſt Sermons and Books which ore heard and read, according as they that ſpeak and write them are famed; and eſteem and approve Doctrines by Perſons,<note place="margin">Tertul. de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript. Haer. cap. 3.</note> and not Perſons by Doctrines, as an Ancient hath it.</p>
            <p>That we might therefore by giving a due report to the Name of this worthy Writer, raiſe a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſeed to him (a deceaſed Brother) and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee to the Uſe and Practice of this his pious Piece, hear us in a few things, as furtherers of thy Faith and Joy.</p>
            <p>For the Compoſer hereof, Reverend Mr. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Lawrence</hi> (though he be now in Heaven above our Praiſes) yet know, he hath by his Doctrine, and living this Doctrine of Faith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> obtained a good report, and was of known integrity, a mighty <hi>Apollos</hi> in the ſacred Scriptures; ſo abundant in alleaging apt and cleef Scriptures for Grounds and Enlargements,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.6.</note> that he might be called, as another once was, <hi>The Ark of the Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118867:5"/>
            <p>His Life and Diſpoſition was made up of a meek and quiet Spirit; a melting Heart towards God, and a healing cloſing Spirit towards Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, though in ſome things diſſenting. Such low Spirits are fitted to receive the high Revelations of Faith, and living by it.</p>
            <p>Such empty Veſſels, are moſt capable of the Oil of the Spirit. The meek,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.</note> he will teach his way. He was indeed a living Paraphraſe and Comment upon his Text; <hi>A Juſt man living by his Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Treatiſe it ſelf, one of us had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of neer Cohabitation ſome years to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author, and lived under the Divine drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of much of this heavenly Doctrine that diſtilled from his lips; which had he been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up unto, as it was faithfully delivered unto him, he might have been more enriched in the ſtock of Faith. The other of us, having peruſed theſe Papers, (though modeſty may forbid him to utter Hyperbolical Praiſes, as being happily, by Providence, united in neereſt Relation with a Branch of that dead-living Stock, the deceaſed Author) yet accounts it but the juſt Honour and Duty he owes him, to judge this Tract, through Gods bleſſing upon a ſerious reading and digeſting it, much conducing to make an able Chriſtian and Divine. Indeed, it holds forth to us the way that we ſhould walk,<note place="margin">Jer. 42.3.</note> and the thing that we ſhould do to attain Heaven and Salvation.</p>
            <p>Many Miniſters and others did deſire the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
<pb facs="tcp:118867:6"/>
of this Treatiſe by the Author in his Life: but his modeſty, and other conſtant labours, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Now it is come forth, we wiſh it may not finde the like entertainment that the Frier wittily and ſharply ſaid his Auditors gave to his Sermons, they dealing with them, as with his Holy-Water, ſprinkled on them; they called for it eagerly, but when he caſt it on them, they preſently wiped it off again. Make this Book now publiſhed, more publick, by holding forth the Life and Practiſe of Faith in thy Life and Station. Do not onely once reade it,<note place="margin">Verba vivenda</note> and caſt it aſide, but carry it in thy heart, as the Carpenter his Rule in his hand, to ſquare all thy actions by it.</p>
            <p>We ſhall onely adde ſome Motives to excite thy Practiſe, and then commit all to the Bleſsing of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, this Life of Faith is a high My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: Chriſt believed on in the world, is a like Myſtery with God manifeſted in the fleſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up into glory. Faith in the habit or root, is not a Plant of Natures Garden: The very nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of it, and cauſing it to bring forth in our hearts, is much more difficult than that of Plants in a ſtrange Country. Grace, in exerciſe is difficult. Indeed its in us, as fire under dead aſhes, or in a Flint: Exciting, quickning, cooperating Grace with us, muſt be added to that within us. Grace in us, lies like ſome Phyſick of dead Drugs, which works not untill ſtronger Phyſick be given. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:118867:6"/>
            <p>But eſpecially, the living daily, in all conditions and actions by the exerciſe of Faith, is much more hard. To believe is above Nature; but to act Faith in each act of Life, is above our very Grace.</p>
            <p>Conſider farther the difficulty of this Life, and ſo make uſe the rather of this Help.</p>

We wonder how ſome men live, who have a ſecret way of Trading: but this is not onely a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Secret, but directly oppoſite to fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>The Carnal and Profane ſcoff at it, as a Fancy, Paradox, and golden Dream of Melancholy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. They count all perſons who admire diſcourſe of, and practiſe this Life of Faith, but ſilly <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> in the world, as Want-wits for managing or getting an Eſtate.

            </p>
            <p>It grieves our Souls to obſerve how many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtians look upon the Uſe of Faith, as the ſtaff of their Old Age onely; or as a ſtrong Cordial onely in fainting Fits; or at beſt, to be worn, as our Holiday-clothes, when we attend on the Word, Prayer, Sacraments: (then put it on.) But this is not to live as becomes Saints, (in all things, and at all times) by our Faith; as that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Scotch Divine, whom M. <hi>Trap</hi> relates to have eat, drank, and ſlept Eternal Life.</p>

            <p>Doſt thou finde it hard to live by thy Labour, by thy Lands, Learning, Friends, Wits? yet all theſe ways are far beneath this high Myſtery of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and living by it.</p>
            <p>Bleſs God then, as for Other, ſo for This Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Aſſemblies, who deſigns in this Work to teach thee this Myſtery and Trade, how to pick a living livelihood out of this (Now) <hi>dead</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, <hi>viZ.</hi> Faith.</p>

            <p>We ſhall not foreſtall thoſe things which thou maiſt finde in the Author; nor diſpute how far ſome Branches of this Tree of Life, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, may ſpring out even in Heaven it ſelf: Yet take this as <hi>Solomons</hi> Argument, that <hi>Wiſdom excells, becauſe it gives life to him that hath it,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.12.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> and others may write of a bleſſed Life, but Faith onely finds it. This Life muſt come from Heaven, which is ſo far above the Earth, and ſo rare to be found in it.</p>

               <hi>Antiſthenes</hi> gained <hi>this</hi> by Study and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he could walk with himſelf, as not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go abroad, and be beholding to others for Exerciſe or Delight.<note place="margin">O theſauris omnibus opulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior fides!

make it the more full. His ſoul, <hi>quae elata eſt,</hi> ſaith one. <hi>Lifted up,</hi> as into a Tower. Pſal. 24.4. who hath not <hi>lifted up his ſoul to vanity.</hi> 2. Others read it, <hi>quae ebullat;</hi> that <hi>ſwells like a bubble,</hi> and ſo at laſt breaks in ſunder. 3. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>quae ſe ſubduxerit,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>unbeleeving ſoul</hi> is not right. So, the Chaldee Bible in a paraphraſtical manenr expreſſeth it thus: <hi>Ecce impii, &amp;c.</hi> Behold the wicked ſay in their heart, theſe things ſhall never come to paſſe; But the juſt ſhall ba made ſtrong in the truth of God</p>
            <p>All theſe readings do not <hi>croſs,</hi> but <hi>confirm</hi> one another. For he that is <hi>lifted up,</hi> his ſoul doth <hi>ſwell like a bubble,</hi> (he is full of aiery and empty conceits;) he that is thus ſwoln is a <hi>proud man,</hi> he that is ſo proud is <hi>an unbeleever,</hi> whoever is an unbeleever, he <hi>withdraws</hi> himſelf (firſt from God's ſervice, then from God's protection) and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, his ſoul is <hi>not right in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle Heb. 10. ſpeaks in the perſon of God,—<hi>My ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> But that is all one too; For Gods ſoul hath no pleaſure in him, whoſe ſoul is not upright in himſelf.</p>
            <p>So then, <hi>non eſt recta,</hi> His ſoul is not <hi>right,</hi> Not <hi>right</hi> in point of <hi>Duty.</hi> For we cannot truſt to God, and truſt to other things too. 2. Not <hi>right</hi> in point of <hi>Safety;</hi> For if God be a rock of confidence, then he that makes other things his confidence, (doth as between two ſtooles.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two rocks he makes ſhipwrack. His ſoul within, his life without is not <hi>right i.e.</hi> quiet, firm, and compoſed, as the Hebraiſme ſignifies; but is unquiet, uneven, and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual. As a ſhip without anchour or ballaſt; for want of faith, his life is miſerable and inconſtant.</p>

even to ſuch, whoſe <hi>names are written in the book of life</hi> This life conſiſts in the union to, &amp; communion of the ſoul with God. 1 Joh. 1.3. <hi>And truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Called 2 Pet. 1.4. a participation <hi>of the Divine nature.</hi> and Eph. 4.24. confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Gods <hi>image in righteouſneſs and holineſs;</hi> and is therefore, the <hi>life of God.</hi> 'Tis a gracious, 'tis a glorious life, and therefore muſt needs be excellent in the nature of it; it is ſomthing indeed to live, if it be but the life of a plant; more, to live the live of a <hi>beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> The life of God's people then is an eternal life, and therefore excellent.

            <p>Seventhly, Laſtly 'tis excellent in regard of <hi>the End.</hi>
               <note place="margin">7. The end of it. The <hi>Caldean imputes</hi> his <hi>power to his God</hi> c. 1.11. <hi>but the juſt,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 'Tis the end crownes the action.

(Rom. 9.23.) and in the <hi>effect</hi> of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might walk worthy of it. As God had life in himſelf and did enjoy himſelf before there was any creature: ſo the reaſon why he made any, or gave life to any, was his own praiſe; And therefore as any creature hath a more excellent life then other, 'tis therefore that God may have more praiſe then from other.

            <p>Therefore 'tis an excellent life, and thence moſt deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Did a beaſt know the life of a man, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; did a natural man know the life of a Chriſtian, he would deſire that too: For it is as farre above the life of a man, as his above the life of a beaſt.</p>

               <p>FOR the firſt; You have the definition, at leaſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſet down by the Holy Ghoſt. Heb. 11.1. <hi>It is the ſubſiſtence of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> For example, tell a natural man of God's favour and the comforts of his Spirit, and the future recompence of reward, which is more worth, then all the comforts of the world, he thinks it a mere notion, that there is no reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it but all feigned. But a Chriſtian by faith ſeeth there is truth, reality and ſubſiſtence in theſe things, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God promiſeth, <hi>who calleth thoſe things that be not, as though they were</hi> Rom. 4.17. To whom <hi>all things are poſſible.</hi> Mark 9.23. And thereby becomes a kind of <hi>omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> faith.</p>
               <p>By others it is defined thus. In general, A believing the Goſpel. In particular,<note place="margin">Definition of Faith.</note> A <hi>gracious habit infuſed into the heart by the Spirit of God, whereby the ſoul reſts, or rolls it ſelf upon Chriſt in a way of promiſe, for all things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to life and godlineſs, for Gods glory and it's own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not then 1. a bare <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> but an <hi>habit.</hi> 2.

               </p>
               <p>So that to live by faith is to reſt ſatisfied with God's <hi>command,</hi> though we ſee no <hi>reaſon</hi> of it;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.8, 9.</note> and with God's <hi>promiſe</hi> though we have no preſent <hi>performance,</hi> yea, even then when <hi>providences</hi> croſſe <hi>promiſes;</hi> as to beleeve we ſhall come to the <hi>Haven</hi> in the greateſt <hi>ſtorm,</hi> in caſe we have a promiſe, as <hi>Paul.</hi> Act. 27.22, &amp;c. As a wordly man (in <hi>his</hi> way) lives comfortably, that hath good ſtore of <hi>bonds</hi> in his coffers, though all his <hi>money</hi> be out of doors, and in other mens hands; how much more do believers live comfortably, that have <hi>bond</hi> and <hi>ſeal,</hi> and <hi>oath</hi> from the God of truth, though they have nothing in <hi>hand</hi> for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Thus the Juſt lives by faith. <hi>Caution.</hi> Not as if there were any natural or moral worth or efficacy in faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get this life, or to make us righteous; But only as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpirit applying Chriſt, our life and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And indeed it is he begets faith in us, <hi>For it is the gift of God.</hi> Eph. 2.8. Chriſt is the <hi>root,</hi> faith is the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of this life.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:118867:32"/>
               <p>Thus living by faith implyes, theſe 4 or 5 things, 1. <hi>Right in Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 2. 2. <hi>A cleering our way</hi> in point of <hi>duty.</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>What is not of faith is ſin.</hi> 3. <hi>a cleering our right</hi> to the <hi>promiſe.</hi> Heb. 11.17.—He that <hi>had received the promiſes.</hi> 4. a conſtant <hi>ſearching of the Scripture</hi> for the <hi>legacyes</hi> bequeathd to us. Joh. 5.39.

Luk. 22.19.</note> 5. A <hi>remembring</hi> them. Pſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 119.52. And a ſeaſonable <hi>applying of</hi> them to particular caſes and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. What can a plaiſter do if it be only kept in the <hi>pocket,</hi> and not laid upon the <hi>ſoare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which implyes, it is not enough to have the <hi>habit</hi> of faith to poſſeſſe it, but the <hi>act</hi> alſo is required that we may comfortably live by it. We muſt put it to uſe. Therfore Act. 13.39, faith is ſet forth by the <hi>act</hi> of beleeving.—By <hi>him, all that beleeve in him are juſtified.</hi> For howſoever it is true He that poſſeſſeth the habit of faith, ſhall never totally and finally fall away; yet for want of acting of it, as he ſins againſt God ſo he looſeth the comfort of his life,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.25. Matth. 8.26.</note> and in his own apprehenſion is like a dead man, or at leaſt exceeding dull, heartleſſe and fearful. Uſually in proportion to the acting of the life of Juſtification will be the ſtrength of the life of Sanctification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for faith works by love, the more faith, the more love. Whence is <hi>Paul</hi>'s exhortation <hi>to blow up the gift of God</hi> in him As a man lives by exerciſe,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.</note> and grows diſeaſed for want of it: So it is in ſpirituals.</p>
               <p>To ſhew then how a Chriſtian lives by faith, this is the ſumme of what hath been ſpoken; He lives by faith as a mean or inſtrument, not as the efficient cauſe or author of this life. But this is the order or <hi>ſeries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, God <hi>predeſtinates</hi> or determines this life to ſuch. Eph. 5.5.—<hi>Having predeſtinated us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He <hi>gives Chriſt</hi> his Son to death for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing this life; becauſe by nature every man is in a ſtate of death; <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes.</hi> Col. 3.4. 1 Joh. 5.12.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:118867:32"/>
               <p>Thirdly, He <hi>makes known</hi> and holds forth this life in a promiſe to poor ſinners Rev. 22.17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He <hi>requires faith in the promiſe</hi> of all ſuch as would have the benefit of this life; that ſo they may glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God's truth and goodneſs and power in beleeving that he will and can make his word good. So he <hi>calls</hi> men to beleeving in the <hi>preaching of the Goſpel</hi> Joh. 3.16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>He beſtowes faith</hi> upon the ſoul of his free grace (becauſe by nature we are ſhut up under unbeleef. Rom. 11.32.) Eph. 2.8.—<hi>it is the gift of God.</hi> So he <hi>calls</hi> men <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by his Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>life</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> come all together. Only he works this life in a way of believing, and makes us ſenſible of it by the act of faith. So that a Chriſtian hath his life from <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>promiſe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3, 3:</note> from the <hi>promiſe</hi> apprehended by <hi>faith:</hi> from <hi>faith</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>by love</hi> and other graces; which is the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of this life. All graces are enlivened by faith; faith receives life from the promiſe; the promiſe from Chriſt; Chriſt as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, from God the Father. Joh. 6.57. God in Chriſt is the fountain of ſpiritual life, the promiſes are ſo many Conduit-pipes that convey it, faith is the hand that turns the Cock, or the mouth to receive the water of life.</p>
               <p>So that however God in Chriſt is the ſole <hi>author</hi> and <hi>finiſher</hi> of ſpiritual life, yet he makes uſe of <hi>faith</hi> all along from firſt to laſt in the order of working, and that in all parts and faculties of ſpiritual life; <hi>viz.</hi> in the quickning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive, nutritive, retentive, motive, and breathing facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God makes uſe of faith in the <hi>Quickning faculty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Quickning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of faith.</note> or firſt infuſion of life. So the juſt lives by his faith. Eph 2.5. with 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Even <hi>when we were dead in ſins, he hath quickned us together with Chriſt</hi>—for <hi>by grace ye are ſaved, through faith.</hi> The heart is <hi>primum vivens</hi> in <hi>grace,</hi> as well as in <hi>nature;</hi> and the heart is enlivened by Chriſt in a way of faith. Eph. 3.16. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118867:33"/>
faith.</hi> So that whereas there is great diſpute among men, whether Chriſt, or faith, or righteouſneſs of life comes firſt to the ſoul; all is anſwered in one word, They come all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, not any one before or after another. <hi>Chriſt brings all along together with himſelf.</hi> So ſoon as ever a ſoul is quickned, it doth believe, and ſo ſoon as ever it believes it is quickned. Yet faith is moſt perceptible in the act of Adherence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Expulſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of faith.</note>Secondly, God makes uſe of faith in the <hi>Expulſive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie;</hi> in expelling the enemies of ſpiritual life. And ſo the juſt lives by his faith. Act 15.9.—<hi>By faith purifying their hearts.</hi> Unbelief and other corruptions are deadly enemies to ſpiritual life. Faith expels them and purifies the heart from them. As the living fountain, if dirt be caſt into it, never leaves working and working, until it hath wrought it ſelf cleer again: So a beleeving heart, if earthly thoughts from Satan, like dirt, be caſt into it, never leaves working, till it hath wrought it ſelf pure, and fit for God's ſervice. 2 Tim. 2.21. <hi>If a man purge himſelf from theſe,</hi> &amp;c. It over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes and abandons all within, and all without, <hi>reſists Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> 1 Pet 5.8, <hi>overcomes the world.</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. Nutritive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of faith.</note>Thirdly, God makes uſe of faith in the <hi>Nutritive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> or attractive faculty, in drawing ſuch things to it ſelf, as whereby is life nouriſhed and maintained. And ſo the juſt lives by his faith. Faith like the firſt-born of graces (though indeed they are all twins) delight to be in the arms of God's mercy (where it firſt receives life,) and there it lyes at the breſt of the word, at the nipple of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, drawing virtue and ſtrength, and nouriſhment from them; <hi>taſting</hi> every day <hi>how ſweet and gracious the Lord is.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.3. Pſal 34.8. O <hi>taſt and ſee that the Lord is good; bleſſed is the man that truſteth in him.</hi> q.d. by truſting in God we live upon God, and taſte how good he is; For elſe we tempt God. It were a miracle to live without meat. But the more ſtrength, the more food.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. Digeſtive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of faith.</note>Fourthly, God maketh uſe of faith in the <hi>Retentive</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118867:33"/>
                  <hi>Digeſtive faculty,</hi> turning the word into wholſome blood. And ſo the juſt lives by his faith. Whereas an unbeliever hearing the word, receiving the food of his ſoul, is like a man of a weak &amp; bad ſtomack; no ſooner is the meat down, but it mixeth with ſome baſe humor &amp; up it comes again; it will hold nothing to do it good. So it is with an unbeliever <hi>not mixing the word with faith;</hi> but being mixed with ſome baſe humour of pride or paſſion, up it comes again with violence, though it be in the very face of the Phyſician. Prov. 9.2. <hi>He that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himſelf a blot.</hi> But where the word is mixed with faith, it meets with a good ſtomack, and there it turnes into good nouriſhment; the party grows and thrives, and comes on in grace, and ſo lives by faith, as a man lives by a good ſtomack. See Pſal. 36.7, 8. <hi>They that put their truſt under the ſhadow of Gods wings, are abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of his houſe,</hi> &amp;c. Good meat doth well, a good ſtomack is better; Gods bleſſing upon both is the beſt of all: and ſo it is in the life of Grace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God makes uſe of Faith in the Motive faculty:<note place="margin">5. Motive faculty of Faith.</note> And ſo the juſt lives by his Faith. For as bodily exerciſe profits much for bodily health (when the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>It profiteth little,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.</note> for doubtleſs, as to bodily health, it profiteth much, it is <hi>inſtar omnium,</hi> in ſtead of all Phyſick, and without this the beſt diet in the world will be defective) It is ſo with the ſoul. Be the diet, the means of grace never ſo good, yet without exerciſe of grace and godlineſs, all comes to nothing. Now it is Faith, and onely true Faith, which puts a man upon profitable exerciſe. Faith will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a man to be idle in his calling It will not onely move his <hi>tongue,</hi> (though it will move <hi>that</hi> too; Acts 4.20. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak</hi>— 2 Cor. 4.13. <hi>I believed, therefore spake</hi>— For he is a very dead-hearted Chriſtian, that hath the <hi>dead palſey</hi> in his tongue, that cannot ſpeak a word for God) But it will move his <hi>hands</hi> alſo, and his <hi>whole

man</hi> to be active for God.<note place="margin">Jam. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works.</hi> Chriſtians full of faith, are full of action, and ſo full of life. (See Acts 6.3, 6, 8, 10) Whereas unbelievers are like ſluggards with <hi>hand in boſome,</hi> or like Idols of the Heathen,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.</note> 
                  <hi>having eyes, and yet ſee not; ears, and hear not; feet, and walk not; neither speak they through their throat:</hi> and ſo prove dead for want of this exerciſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6. Breathing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Faith.</note>Sixthly, God makes uſe of Faith in the <hi>Breathing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:</hi> And ſo the juſt lives by his faith. Breath is the Chariot of life; called therefore, <hi>The breath of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> This breathing is twofold: 1. <hi>Inspiration:</hi> 2. <hi>Expiration;</hi> theſe maintain life. And both theſe in a ſpiritual ſenſe do ſpring from Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1. Inſpiration.</note>Firſt, for the act of <hi>Inspiration.</hi> For howſoever, every <hi>firſt</hi> inſpiration of the Spirit gives life, yet Faith draws more and more of this heavenly <hi>air</hi> from day to day, for the maintaining and increaſing of this life. A man can no more live a ſpiritual life, without the continual breathing of Gods Spirit into his ſoul, than he can live a natural life without the continual ſucking in of freſh air into his body. And therefore it is obſervable, Our bleſſed Saviour choſe to convey the Holy Ghoſt under that ſimilitude: Joh. 20.22. <hi>He breathed on them, and ſaid, Receive the Holy Ghoſt; q. d.</hi> Ye can no more live the life of grace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my Spirit, than you can live the life of nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the breath of your noſthrils. We are all by nature like <hi>Ezekiels dried bones.</hi> Now it is the voice of Faith that cryes out,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37.9.</note> 
                  <hi>O Breath, breathe upon theſe ſlain, that they may live.</hi> And again, when a man hath life, and begins to exerciſe himſelf in the way of Gods Commandments, he knows he cannot exerciſe to purpoſe, unleſs it be in this freſh air of the Spirit. Therefore <hi>Davids</hi> Faith put him upon this practice, <hi>I opened my mouth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and panted; for I longed for thy Commandments,</hi> Pſa. 119.131. He took in <hi>freſh gales</hi> of the Spirit from day to day, to uphold the <hi>vitals</hi> of the New man.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:118867:34"/>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Expiration.</note> There is another act of the Spirit in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, and that is Expiration; an holy <hi>breathing out</hi> of holy <hi>speeches,</hi> and holy <hi>prayers.</hi> And uſually in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our <hi>inſpiration,</hi> will be our <hi>expiration.</hi> As in Nature, 'tis unwholeſome to breathe out more then we ſuck in, when the <hi>expence</hi> of ſpirits is beyond our <hi>receipts:</hi> ſo alſo in grace, when our expiration of holy ſpeeches, doth exceed our inſpiration of the holy Spirit. But when theſe go hand in hand, all ſprings from Faith, 2 Cor. 4.13. We having <hi>the ſame Spirit of faith, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I believed, therefore have I spoken; we alſo believe, and therefore speak.</hi> Faith will put a Chriſtian upon it. Faith is as it were the very <hi>breath of his noſtrils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, God makes uſe of Faith in the <hi>Augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or <hi>growing</hi> faculty: And ſo the juſt lives by his Faith.<note place="margin">7. Augmentative faculty of Faith.</note> As Faith grows, (for Rom. 1.17. the righteouſneſs of God is revealed from <hi>faith to faith</hi>) ſo other graces grow with it. See 2 Theſſ. 1.3. having mentioned the growing of their <hi>faith;</hi> then follows, And <hi>the charity of every one of you aboundeth.</hi> So 2 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Adde to your faith vertue, and to vertue,</hi> &amp;c. all follow Faith. Again, 2 Pet. 3. laſt, <hi>Grow in grace:</hi> how? —<hi>and in the knowledge</hi> (or faith) <hi>of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Shew me thy <hi>faith by thy works,</hi> Jam. 2. Not onely the <hi>truth,</hi> but the <hi>meaſure</hi> of our Faith is ſeen by our <hi>works.</hi> And ſo much for the ſecond general Queſtion, <hi>What it is to live by Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Onely now it were good to examine our ſelves upon all this, Whether we do thus live by Faith, making our particular application of our ſouls to each of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars fore-mentioned? But I paſs to the third Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>

                  <hi>QUESTION III.</hi> Why a Chriſtian is ſaid to live by Faith, rather than any other Grace?</head>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> WHy not by <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Thankefulneſs,</hi> or <hi>Patience,</hi> &amp;c? The reaſon is (in a word; for what is ſaid already may give light hereunto:) <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe Faith is not onely the grace which receives Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> who is our Life; but it is alſo the grace that receives all other grace from Chriſt. Therefore Faith is the firſt <hi>link</hi> of all that <hi>Chain</hi> of Graces, 2 Pet. 1.5, &amp;c. at leaſt in order to their working. Otherwiſe indeed, we know all graces are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> in reſpect of their being and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence. See Joh. 7.38. <hi>He that believeth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> The graces of the Spirit run into the Soul, and out again in the iſſues of life, and all through the conduit-pipe of Faith.</p>
               <p>Indeed a Chriſtian hath great uſe of other graces, but Faith onely layes hold on Chriſt for all. Sanctified <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> ſaith, There is an infinite fulneſs in Chriſt, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Fountain; <hi>Faith</hi> ſaith, This is all for me, for he is my Husband; then <hi>Prayer</hi> ſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If all this be thine, I will go and fetch it for thee; and <hi>Thankefulneſs</hi> ſayes, I will return praiſe to God for it (and that's better than the receiving of mercies) Pſal 63.5. <hi>My ſoul ſhall be filled with marrow and fatneſs, and my mouth ſhall praiſe thee with joyful lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is plain therefore, however ſpiritual life is much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in other graces, as well as in Faith; as in Prayer, and Patience, and Love, and Thankfulneſs: yet becauſe Faith acts and exerciſes, and puts life into all, therefore a Chriſtian is ſaid rather to live by his Faith. As may be ſeen, Heb. 11. through the whole Chapter. For Prayer
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118867:35"/>
is no prayer, unleſs it be a prayer of Faith, Jam 5. and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is no patience, unleſs joyned with Faith, <hi>Here is the faith and patience of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 13. and ſo of all the reſt.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe Faith layes hold upon that <hi>Word</hi> by which man lives. For <hi>man lives by the word of God,</hi> Mat 4.4. Other graces are <hi>begotten</hi> by the Word, but do not <hi>lay hold</hi> on the Word. So as no word, no means can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit us without Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> 
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe when other graces and comforts (to our ſenſe) lie dead, and uſeleſs, even then Faith lives, and acts its part. It is like the <hi>Cork</hi> that ſwims aloft, when the <hi>Leads,</hi> and all the <hi>Net</hi> is under water. It is like the <hi>Card</hi> or <hi>Compaſs,</hi> when Heaven and Earth fail; no ſight of Earth or Heaven, or comfort from either; when 'tis a day of <hi>darkneſs and gloomineſs,</hi> as that deſcribed <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.15. or when 'tis with us, as it was in <hi>Pauls</hi> voyage, Acts 27.13. to 26. <hi>neither ſun nor ſtar appearing for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes;</hi> or a time as that, Iſa. 50.10. <hi>wherein we ſit in darkneſs, and ſee no light;</hi> yet then ſaith, <hi>can truſt in the Name of the Lord.</hi> It is as an <hi>Anchor</hi> in a ſtorm; ſo long as the Anchor holds, there is hope; but if that break, there is no more governance of the Ship. So Faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, Heb. 6.19. It is as the Widows <hi>Oyl;</hi> when all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proviſion failed, ſhe lives upon that, becauſe ſhe had a word from God. So when all fail, Faith ſhall not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally nor finally fail, becauſe there is a word from God, which was ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> in perſon, of all the faithful, Luke 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Or like the <hi>heart</hi> in the body, though other parts be dead, yet ſo long as the heart lives, the man is <hi>alive.</hi> Pſa. 73.26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> lived by Faith when all failed, and by it thus ſpeaks himſelf, Pſal. 42.5. <hi>Why art thou diſquieted, O my ſoul? — ſtill truſt in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him.</hi>

When graces fail, performances fail, ſo that we abhor our ſelves and duties, yet Faith ſayes, <hi>We are a holy Prieſthood, to offer up spiritual ſacrifices, acceptable to God</hi> (1 Pet. 2.5.) <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out, Rom. 7. <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. yet by Faith he can <hi>thank God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When the Church is under water, yet ſhe can ſpeak thus in Faith, Mic. 7.8. <hi>Rejoyce not over me, O mine enemy; though I fall, I ſhall riſe again.</hi> When <hi>Job</hi> conſiders his body turned to <hi>duſt and worms,</hi> Job 19.19, 25. yet by Faith he ſees, <hi>my Redeemer lives,</hi> &amp;c. Even when <hi>Patience</hi> failed in <hi>Job,</hi> yet <hi>Faith</hi> failed not. Though God kill all other graces and comforts, and my ſoul too, yet he ſhall not kill my Faith, ſayes he. If he ſeparate my ſoul from my body, yet not Faith from my Soul. If he kill me, he ſhall not kill my Faith. And therefore the juſt lives by Faith, rather then other graces, becauſe when all is <hi>gone,</hi> yet Faith <hi>remains;</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> remains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Promiſe</hi> remains: <hi>For ever, O Lord, thy word is ſetled in the heavens,</hi> Pſal. 119.89.

               </p>
               <p>But that is not all.

               <p>Yet mark: He doth not ſay, The <hi>juſt</hi> ſhall live by his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> becauſe the righteouſneſs of <hi>Sanctification</hi> is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,</hi> and deſerves death: but by <hi>his Faith,</hi> becauſe that implyes the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, and that is <hi>perfect.</hi> And this diſtinction
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118867:37"/>
is enough to avoid that evil and ſlander, which is caſt upon the Miniſters of the Goſpel at this day. They ſay, we preach Law and Goſpel,<note place="margin">Note.</note> Chriſt and VVorks both ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in point of Juſtification. But this is a meer Cavil. For however we teach, That every believer muſt evidence his Faith, or his Righteouſneſs of Juſtification, by his works of Sanctification; yet we do not ſay his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Sanctification, is his Righteouſneſs of Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no more then we ſay, His Righteouſneſs of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is his Righteouſneſs of Sanctification (as ſome would vainly confound one with the other.) Though we ſay, He that <hi>believes the Gospel,</hi> muſt do the <hi>things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Law;</hi> yet we do not ſay, <hi>He that doth them ſhall live in them</hi> (for that is the voice of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Covenant of the Law) but we ſay, <hi>He that doth them ſhall live by his Faith:</hi> (for that's the voice of the ſecond Covenant, the Covenant of the Goſpel, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Free-grace. For this tells us, There muſt be a juſtice in the perſon that believes, (not an <hi>antecedent,</hi> but a <hi>conſequent</hi> juſtice) yet he lives not by his juſtice, but by his faith; and by his faith, as applying the Free-grace of God in Chriſt. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> And thus for the fourth Queſtion, <hi>Who it is that lives by his Faith?</hi>

Parents faith may do much for the ſpiritual good of their children: <hi>By faith Iſaac bleſſed Jacob, and Eſau, concerning things to come;</hi> and, <hi>By faith Jacob bleſſed both the ſons of Joſeph,</hi> Heb. 11.20, 21. They plead a kinde of <hi>hereditary</hi> right by the <hi>grand Charter.</hi> As the Devils Covenant runs much <hi>in a blood,</hi> (many times) where there is a curſe upon a family: ſo Gods Covenant, where there is a bleſſing, Gen. 17.7. <hi>I will bleſs thee, and thy ſeed after thee.</hi> And ſo Rom 11. <hi>They are beloved for the fathers ſake,</hi> i.e. for Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Free-grace made unto the Fathers, and pleaded, and ſued out by the faithful. Parents have God <hi>upon the hip</hi> (to ſpeak with reverence) when they wreſtle with him in Prayer for their children. So you reade of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:118867:39"/>
an hereditary faith, as of hereditary temporal poſſeſſions; and 'tis a ſtrong hold, if the <hi>Livery</hi> be ſued out: <hi>I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith which is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.5. 'Tis a ſtrong pair of <hi>bellows</hi> to blow up the grace of God to a great flame. So in the Miniſtery, who are ſpiritual Parents, faith may do much good exerciſed in Preaching and Prayer, to beget the like faith in others; as one Candle lights another, or one Natural Life begets another: ſo one Spiritual Life begets another, by <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſeed of the Word,</hi> warm'd and inlivened by the Spirit of God. 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>Though you have ten thouſand inſtructers in Chriſt, yet not many fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Gospel.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle writing both to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> uſeth great boldneſs of ſpeech, 1 Tim. 12. <hi>To Timothy, my own ſon in the faith;</hi> 1 Tit. 4. <hi>To Titus, my own ſon after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith,</hi> ſayes he.

Phil. 4.1. <hi>My brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for, my joy, and crown, ſo ſtand faſt in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</hi> The Apoſtle calls the believing Philippians, his <hi>joy,</hi> yea his <hi>crown</hi> of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; his Crown, not onely <hi>here,</hi> but <hi>hereafter</hi> to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Dan. 12.3. <hi>They that turn many to righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> O how ſhould this quicken us to the duty!

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by faith in troubles.</note>1. That he does it, 1. In preventing the ſtorm: So 2 Kings 19.6. upon <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> prayer of faith, the ſtorm of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> invaſion was driven back. And Jon. 3. the Ninevites believing God, drave back that ſtorm threatned by <hi>Jonah.</hi> Nor Devils nor Witches have any power over a man, if he believes; therefore Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22.32. <hi>Simon, Simon, Satan hath deſired to have you, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118867:48"/>
he may winnow you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</hi> as if he had ſaid, So long as Faith holds out, Satan hath no power, <hi>whom therefore reſiſt, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in the faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In looking at God <hi>Ordaining</hi> all troubles; <hi>ſc.</hi> 1. That every man muſt look for ſome, Rom 8.29. where ſpeaking of ſufferings, he ſayes, <hi>We were predeſtinate to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the image of his Son.</hi> 2. What and how many every man ſhall have. Faith ſees the Cup in a Fathers hand: <hi>Thou couldſt have no power, unleſs it were givon thee from above,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Pilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In looking at God <hi>Ordering</hi> and <hi>Dispoſing</hi> all things in middeſt of Confuſion. <hi>Joſeph</hi> his ſelling, impriſoning, and exalting again, all was by Gods diſpoſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though the inſtruments knew it not. Phil. 1.12. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, that <hi>the things which happened to him,</hi> ſeemingly as a ſtoppage, in truth made <hi>for a furtherance of the Goſpel.</hi> And Rom. 8.28. <hi>We know that all things work together for good, to them that love God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In ſeeing God <hi>Bounding</hi> and <hi>Limiting</hi> troubles, as in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, Chap. 2. When affliction breaks in as the ſea, Faith hears God ſay, <hi>Huc uſque;</hi> Hitherto, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhall thy proud waves come: Iſa. 10 22. <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption determined, ſhall overflow in righteouſneſs.</hi> And ſo again, Iſa. 27.7, 8. <hi>In meaſure thou wilt debate with it: He will ſtay his rough wind in the day of the eaſt wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſeeing Gods <hi>Protection;</hi> that however the ſtorm comes to fall upon us, yet he is ſo merciful, as to hold his holy hand of protection over us. Yea, Pſal. 91.4. <hi>He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt, his truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. In <hi>Supporting,</hi> or ſeeing <hi>Gods Support;</hi> that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſtorm comes and falls upon us without any <hi>ſhelter,</hi> yet God is merciful in giving ſufficient ſtrength to bear it: 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118867:49"/>
make a way to eſcape, that you may be able to bear.</hi> It is many times a wonder, nay a Miracle, to ſee how God ſupports his people, when they cannot get off the trouble, yet making them hear, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> viz. my grace applied by faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In <hi>Sanctifying troubles:</hi> Rev. 7.17. There, they that <hi>came out of great tribulations, waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</hi> There is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity in all afflictions; but faith in Chriſt crucified, takes away that malignity and venomous ſting? Iſa. 27 9. <hi>This is all the fruit</hi> (of thoſe troubles) <hi>To purge away their ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. In <hi>Saving and Delivering,</hi> or fitting the ſoul for deliverance; that howſoever troubles lie on a great while, the Lord will ſend help in due time: Therefore God is ſtyled, A <hi>preſent help</hi> in time of trouble, Pſal. 46. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>many be the troubles of the righteous, yet the Lord delivers them out of all,</hi> as it is Pſal. 34.19. Wherefore it is noted, that it was by faith, that Iſrael was delivered out of Egypt, when they paſſed through the Red ſea, Heb. 11.29.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In <hi>Sanctifying Deliverance:</hi> Luke 1.74, 75. <hi>Who hath delivered us out of the hands of our enemies, that we might ſerve him, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all the dayes of our lives.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Means of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by faith in troubles.</note>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, in weighing <hi>spiritual mercies</hi> againſt <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral evils.</hi> 1 Sam. 30.6. <hi>David</hi> ready to be ſtoned, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himſelf <hi>in the Lord his God.</hi> The Lord himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds a ſpiritual mercy againſt a temporal evil, to ſuſtain his people under it. Iſa 30.20. <hi>Though the Lord give you the bread of affliction, and the water of affliction, yet ſhall not thy Teachers be removed into a corner.</hi> The Apoſtle make uſe of ſuch a ſupport, 2 Cor. 4.16, 17. <hi>For this cauſe we faint not; for though our outward man periſh,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:118867:49"/>
our inward man is renewed day by day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In making the ſoul to reſt <hi>upon the naked Word of God,</hi> though it be againſt ordinary reaſon. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.17. <hi>Believed in hope againſt hope —according to what was spoken, ſo ſhall thy ſeed be.</hi> In hope of <hi>Faith,</hi> againſt hope of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Thus by faith we believe the Creation of the World by the bare Word of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out precedent matter, Heb. 11.3. Faith looks up to the promiſe. Iſa. 43.1, 2. —<hi>When thou paſſeſt through the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they ſhall not overflow thee. when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In enabling the ſoul to relye on <hi>Gods Attributes,</hi> which make good his Word and Promiſe. As 1. <hi>His Power,</hi> Gen. 17.1. I am God <hi>Almighty,</hi> walk before me, and be thou perfect. 2. <hi>His Truth,</hi> (and this binds him, as Power enables him to help) Pſal. 31.5. Into thy hands I commit my Spirit—<hi>O Lord God of Truth.</hi> Heb. 11.11. <hi>Sarah</hi> believed him <hi>faithful</hi> who had promiſed. 3. <hi>His Love,</hi> to help, and even to prevent, as the Prodigal's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ran to meet his ſon afar off. Iſa. 65.24. Yea, <hi>before they call, I will anſwer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</hi> See Pſal. 32.5. 4 <hi>His <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſs.</hi> Jam. 1.17. with <hi>whom there is no ſhadow of change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In making the <hi>abſent good</hi> to be <hi>preſent.</hi> Faith looks beyond the clouds and skies, and ſeek all clear above. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Heb. 11.25, &amp;c. looks through the affliction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt, and ſees the <hi>recompence of reward. We rejoyce</hi> (now) ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>in hope of glory,</hi> Rom. 5.2. So faith ſees the after-good of the Church as preſent, Revel. 18.2. <hi>Babylon,</hi> as good as <hi>fallen</hi> above a thouſand years before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſtrengthning <hi>Patience.</hi> Therefore Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience are joyned together. So Heb. 10.35, 36, 37. Caſt not away your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward: For, <hi>you have need of patience, that when you
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:118867:50"/>
have done the will of God, you may inherit the promiſe.</hi> Now by patience we poſſeſs our ſouls; through it, all is calm within, while ſtorms are without. A wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience within, is worſe then the outward burthen; like a ſore back to the horſe: But faith heals this ſore, giving us <hi>peace</hi> with God, and ſo enables to bear the outward bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, the inward burthen being removed. As for this, it caſts all the burthen of its cares, fears and ſorrows, upon God; and ſo is quiet. And thus much for the Life of Faith in thoſe Adverſities which happen in the courſe of our Life.</p>
               <p>Now ſee how he lives the Life of Faith in Death.</p>

See <hi>Paul</hi> for further inſtance, 2 Cor. 5. from v. 1. to 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Believers dye in faith, becauſe they ſee it a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd enemy. <hi>Death,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> by Chriſt. Hoſ. 13.13. <hi>O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy deſtruction.</hi> 'Tis part of Chriſts victory to conquer Death: 1. By conquering the <hi>devil, that had the power of death.</hi> 2. Our <hi>fear of death,</hi> See Heb. 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſee the <hi>ſting of death</hi> pull'd out; ſo conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as diſarmed. 1 Cor. 15.55. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting! —The ſting of death is ſin—But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſee it, not onely a conquered and diſarmed enemy, but made <hi>their ſervant. All things are yours,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to believers, 1 Cor. 3.21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. as <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas</hi> are yours, ſo <hi>death is yours,</hi> ſayes he.

               <p n="5">5. Nay, they ſee it as a <hi>Friend.</hi> 1. In <hi>freeing</hi> them from the miſeries of this life: 2. In being their <hi>Porter</hi> or Uſher into eternal life. There are five Concomitants of this life which make it troubleſome, and Death befriends the Saints in them all, by taking them away from them.</p>
               <p>There is,
<list>
                     <item>1. The <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> of their <hi>Natures,</hi> which makes them cry out with <hi>Paul, O wretched man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I am, who ſhall deliver,</hi> &amp;c?</item>

                     <item>3. The <hi>Wickedneſs of the World,</hi> that conſtrains the Saints many times to complain with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 120.5. <hi>Woe is me that I ſojourn in Meſech, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. There are alſo <hi>Gods judgements</hi> upon the world. In which reſpect death makes the godly happy: for as 'tis Iſa. 57.1, 2.—<hi>they are taken away from the evil to come;</hi> they reſt in their beds, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>5. The laſt evil Concomitant is, the believers <hi>diſtance from Chriſt:</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6. while we <hi>are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord: therefore we deſire,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to be abſent from the body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Death is not onely chang'd to a believer, but faith in death is ſeen alſo by <hi>altering our judgements</hi> concerning death. The natural face of death is terrible to Nature, and fear'd: but faith ſees it with deſire. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> can ſay, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolv'd.</hi> Chriſt hath not onely conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death for his, but the fear of death, as was ſaid before, Heb. 2.14.</p>
               <p>And this reſolves the ſecond part of the Queſtion, <hi>How long</hi> a believer is to live by his faith: and that is, All his life long, till death, and then in death: Therefore 'tis ſaid, Rev. 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</hi> And Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> (all the while I live) <hi>by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. Hence the word of the Text is put in the Future tenſe, [The juſt <hi>ſhall</hi> live by his faith] to ſignifie the perpetuity of this life of faith. As long as we live, we muſt live by faith.</p>
               <p>But no longer. And therefore though <hi>Faith</hi> is excellent in ſome reſpect; yet <hi>Love</hi> is more excellent in another, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of <hi>durance.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8. to the end, 'tis

Such a charge God gives to his Word, (and to faith the lanthorn-bearer) Pſal. 119.105. <hi>Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths:</hi> Go, give ſuch a man light until he come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and leave him there. Or, as God gave Commiſſion to the Angel, Acts 12. to awaken <hi>Peter,</hi> and to ſhake off his chain, to clothe him with garments, to open the gates, to lead him through the firſt and ſecond Ward: and when he had done ſo, forthwith the Angel departed from him. Juſt ſo, Faith is like this Angel; it <hi>awakens</hi> us out of the the ſleep of ſin, ſhakes off the <hi>chains</hi> of Satan, <hi>clothes</hi> us with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>opens</hi> the door of the ear and heart, <hi>leads</hi> us through the firſt and ſecond Ward of all oppoſitions and temptations, yea through the iron gate of <hi>death</hi> it ſelf, and then it leaves us.

So Faith is a ſweet companion, to direct us in a right way in the wilderneſs of this life, till we come to the Celeſtial Canaan, that flows with the <hi>milk and honey</hi> of Gods Beatifical Preſence; and then it leaves us, becauſe then we ſhall have in poſſeſſion what before we did hope

A man hath no uſe of a Ship or Boat any longer than he is at Sea; when he once comes to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it will carry him no further; if he will have it any further, he muſt carry it, it will not carry him: So faith carries a man upon the waters of this troubleſome world, till we come to the haven of Eternal Happineſs, and then there is no further uſe of it. In the mean-while, make much of it, and take heed above all things, that thou make not ſhipwrack of faith.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19.</note> To conclude, Faith is a Chriſtians Companion all along: it ſaith to the Soul, as <hi>Ruth</hi> to her Mother, Ruth 1.16, 17. —<hi>Whither thou goeſt, I will go; and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge; where thou dieſt, will I die, and there will I be buried.</hi>

               <p>ANd the Anſwer is very general, <hi>All kinde of life,</hi> that may truly be called life. For the life of ſinners, though never ſo pleaſurable, is a death rather than a life. <hi>He or ſhe that liveth in pleaſures, is dead while ſhe liveth,</hi> 1 Tim 5.6. yea, <hi>twice dead,</hi> Jude v. 12. For the death of the ſoul, is the ſeparation of the ſoul from God, who is the life of the ſoul, as the ſoul is the life of the body.</p>
               <p>But all kinde of life, that is worth the name of life, the juſt lives it, by faith. Therefore 'tis ſpoken of, indefinitely [The juſt ſhall <hi>live,</hi> &amp;c.] that it may include all lives. As all life comes from that God in whom there is a Trinity of Perſons: ſo from this God, the juſt doth enjoy a Trinity of lives. 'Tis ſaid, Gen. 2.7. <hi>Jehovah Elohim breathed into mans noſtrils the breath of lives;</hi> viz. either the <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative</hi> life, common with Plants, the <hi>Senſitive,</hi> common with Beaſts; and <hi>Rational,</hi> common with Angels: Or elſe take it of life <hi>Natural, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Eternal:</hi> All which, in ſome reſpect, the juſt lives, by vertue of his faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, for <hi>Natural Life:</hi> he lives this, by faith (I ſpeak not of corrupt Nature,<note place="margin">I. Natural life lived by faith.</note> but of that life which flows from the conjunction of Soul and Body) 1. In reſpect of the act of living. Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I,</hi>

And this implies many particulars: For Faith teacheth a man, 1. To improve his <hi>Natural</hi> life, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking ſome place of imployment in a <hi>civil</hi> life. It will not ſuffer a man to live without a Calling. So 1. Cor. 7.20. Let <hi>every man abide in the ſame calling, wherein he was called:</hi> which is meant of a particular Calling, and ſuppoſes every Chriſtian muſt have ſuch a Calling: for he mentions it as a charge under that general, of keeping the Commands of God, ver. 19. 2. It ſtirs a man up to look to God for gifts for the diſcharge of that Calling. 1 Kin. 3.7, 9. Now O Lord my God, thou haſt made thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant King,—<hi>and I am but a little childe, I know not how to go out and in</hi>— Give therefore thy ſervant an underſtanding heart to judge thy people, &amp;c. So the Apoſtle directs to live by faith in this caſe, as well as other: Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask of God.</hi> 3. It ſtirs a man up in the uſe of thoſe gifts, to ſeek not his own things, but the things of other men. <hi>Non nobis ſolum nati ſumus;</hi> No man is born to ſerve himſelf, but his generation: Acts 13.36. <hi>David,</hi> after he had <hi>ſerved his generation accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God,</hi> fell aſleep. A Chriſtian hath not a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118867:57"/>
private, but a publick ſpirit. 4. It ſtirs him up in ſerving his generation, and in ſerving men, to ſerve God, Eph 6 5. Even ſervants (there) in ſerving their Maſters, are to <hi>ſerve Chriſt.</hi> So again, Col. 3.22. Iſrael is reproved (Hoſ 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>1.) becauſe as an <hi>empty vine</hi> he brings forth <hi>fruit unto himſelf.</hi> As one end of natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to depend upon God in all for good Succeſſe. So we are taught, Prov. 3.5, 6. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not to thine own underſtanding: in all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy paths.</hi> Pſal. 1.3. Whatſoever the righteous doth, the <hi>Lord ſhall make it to proſper.</hi> 6. It teacheth him to make a voluntary, humble, and bold Reſignation of his calling, and ſo of his civil life, and natural life alſo into Gods hands, when he ſhall call for it. As in the forementioned example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (Acts 13.36.) who fell aſleep, according to the will of God, as ſoon as he had ſerved his generation. So <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> (Numb. 20.23 &amp;c.) by faith put off his Office, as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly as a man puts off his clothes, when he goes to bed. Such a diſpoſition there was in <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim 4.6, 7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe—henceforth a crown of Glory, &amp;c.</hi> As a believers ſucceſs is from God, ſo into Gods hands he reſignes his place with his Spirit And then he may lay down his head, he may lay down his life with comfort.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118867:58"/>
be a <hi>Prodigal</hi> nor a <hi>Niggard</hi> of it. Faith teaches a man neither to undervalue nor overvalue his life. A Chriſtian holds the rein of life by the hand of faith, neither too <hi>faſt,</hi> nor too <hi>looſe.</hi> Reaſon will teach a man a <hi>notional</hi> valuation of his life, but onely faith will teach a man a <hi>practical</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not to <hi>undervalue</hi> it. Natural Reaſon tells a man That of all temporal bleſſings, natural life is the greateſt; but every ſinner ſets more by his luſts than his life. 1. The <hi>envious perſon,</hi> whiles he envies another mans life, pines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way himſelf, and deſtroyes his own: He is neither fit to live by others, nor enjoy his own life: Prov. 14.30. <hi>Envy is the rottenneſs of the bones.</hi> 2. The <hi>luſtful</hi> and <hi>luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> perſon, he ſins againſt his own body: He falls not onely into a conſumption of his eſtate, but his fleſh alſo; Prov. 5 10, 11. And <hi>mourn, when thy fleſh and thy body are conſumed.</hi> 3. The <hi>covetous</hi> perſon; he loves his goods better then his life. If it would ſave his life, <hi>he hath not power to eat thereof,</hi> Eccleſ. 6.2. He puniſheth both back and belly, and ſo waſtes his life, and dies. If a man had faith, it would rectifie Reaſon in theſe particulars, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fortifie Reaſon by Scripture: Mat. 6.25. <hi>Is not life better than raiment,</hi> &amp;c? yea, the Devil could allege, That <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life,</hi> Job 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to <hi>overvalue</hi> life. An unbeliever overvalues his life, when he prizeth it above his ſoul, which is the life of his life; yea, above the Goſpel and Chriſt, who is the life of his ſoul: Mat. 19.20, 21, 22. The young man there would not exchange his poſſeſſions for treaſure in heaven. But faith teacheth better husbandry, not onely to loſe goods, but life alſo for the Goſpels ſake: Acts 20. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my life dear, ſo I may finiſh my courſe with joy. Paul</hi> counted his life cheap in compariſon of the Goſpel, and the preaching of it. Heb. 11.35. <hi>Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:118867:58"/>
obtain a better reſurrection.</hi> He that either undervalues or overvalues his life, he murthers himſelf; the one directly, by loving danger; the other indirectly and by conſequent, expoſing himſelf to the judgement of God: for Mat. 10.39 <hi>He that findeth his life ſhall loſe it, and he that loſeth his life for my ſake, ſhall finde it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the juſt lives by faith, in regard of the good things of this natural or temporal life, as well as of eternal life; as he hath the promiſes for <hi>this life,</hi> as well as for <hi>that which is to come.</hi> Look as the ſame love and care in an earthly parent, that moves him to give an inheritance to his Son at the laſt, moves him to maintain him, and provide for him in the mean time: And the ſame ſpirit of filial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance that moves the childe to depend upon his fathers love and care to provide him an inheritance, moves him to depend upon him for maintenance in his minority: So 'tis in this caſe; the ſame faith that moves us to depend upon God for eternal life, moves us to depend upon him for the good things of this life; and the one aſſures us of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Luke 12.12. <hi>Fear not little flock (viz.</hi> in regard of temporal proviſion) <hi>for it is your heavenly fathers pleaſure to give you the Kingdome.</hi> And in truth, he that will not truſt God for a <hi>penny,</hi> will not truſt him for a <hi>pound:</hi> He that will not truſt him for temporal life, how will he truſt him for eternal?</p>
               <p>But ſo much for the firſt; The believers living by faith in reſpect of the life which we call natural.</p>
               <p>Some Uſe of this Branch.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Exhortation, to live by faith in reſpect of this life, and the things of this life. And indeed, God doth train up his ſervants to exerciſe faith for better things, by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing their faith firſt in things of leſſer moment. The Church in her infancy was trained up this way; God firſt exerciſed her faith for earthly Canaan, and then for that which is heavenly. So 'tis with each Chriſtian in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy: God doth firſt exerciſe his faith in things more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and then in things more ſpiritual. And if we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe not faith and faithfulneſs in theſe, how can we exerciſe the ſame in things of higher concernment? Luke 16.10, 11. <hi>If ye have been unfaithful in the unright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. HE lives by faith the Life of Juſtification, and ſo the Apoſtle applies this very Text: Rom. 1.16, 17. <hi>For therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith,</hi> as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. And ſo again, Gal. 3.11. (where he doth oppoſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying by faith, to juſtification by works of the law) <hi>But that no man is juſtified by the law in the ſight of God, it is evident; for the juſt,</hi> &amp;c. The juſt doth not live by his own juſtice, but by faith; that is, by the application of the juſtice and righteouſneſs of another.</p>
                  <p>That we may the better underſtand the excellency of this Life of Juſtification, it will not be amiſs to adde the definition of it, according to the Scriptures ſeeing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is truly known, is known by the cauſes thereof. Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therefore is thus defined: <q>It is a moſt gracious and righteous action of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he imputing the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to a believing ſinner, abſolveth him from his ſins, and accepteth of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118867:61"/>
him as righteous in Chriſt, and as an heir of eternal life, to the praiſe and glory of his own Mercy and Juſtice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Explication, conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Act; to <hi>juſtifie.</hi> 2. The Object; a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and yet a <hi>believing</hi> ſinner, and <hi>ſo</hi> made righteous. 3. The Application of the Act to the Object; and that's onely by Faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Act to <hi>juſtifie:</hi> Now to juſtifie, ſignifieth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to make juſt; as to magnifie, to make great (though ſometimes onely to <hi>declare</hi> great) Now God makes juſt, either</p>

                  <p>The firſt is the life of Juſtification; the ſecond of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification: the firſt perfect, the latter imperfect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Object is a <hi>ſinner:</hi> God doth not juſtifie thoſe that were juſt before, but ſuch as were unjuſt: 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Chriſt hath once offered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> There was a time then, when we were unjuſt, a time when we were ſinners, when we were ungodly: Rom. 5.6. <hi>Chriſt dyed for the ungodly;</hi> and, <hi>While we were yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt dyed for us, much more then being juſtified, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> So that as to heal, ſignifies of a ſick man to make ſound; ſo, to juſtifie, is of a ſinner to make righteous: and if it were not ſo, where were the excellency of Gods free grace to make us righteous, if we never were in a ſtate of ſin? He that in no conſideration looks at himſelf as a ſinner fallen in the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> cannot poſſibly look at himſelf as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon recovered in the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> How can God be ſaid to ſhew mercy to that man, that was never in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery? to redeem that man, that was never loſt?

                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>firſt Act</hi> and work of Juſtification.<note place="margin">Faith in the act of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Faith <hi>Convinceth</hi> a man of ſin in a ſaving manner,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118867:64"/>
and ſo of his need of Chriſt, and of his own impotency to obtain Juſtification and Salvation without Chriſt, Mat. 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in spirit;</hi> as Gal. 5.6. <hi>Faith worketh by love;</hi> ſo by poverty of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith puts perſons into a <hi>Mourning,</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, prayerful frame, Mat. 5.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn;</hi> but no bleſſedneſs, if not ſpringing from faith. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>I will pour upon them the Spirit of grace and ſupplication, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 31.9. <hi>They ſhall come with weepings, and with ſupplications will I lead them.</hi> Acts 2.37. <hi>They were pricked at their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. This is the work of Faith, though not alwayes ſo eaſily diſcerned to be of Faith by the party himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faith <hi>ſubdues</hi> the heart, to lay down all <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> againſt God, and to be willing to take any courſe God directs for Juſtification and Salvation. Matth. 5.5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 9.5, 6. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Jer. 31.18. <hi>Surely I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf, Thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God, &amp;c.</hi> He ſubmits obediently; they are tame as a <hi>lamb,</hi> Iſa. 11.6.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Faith <hi>fixeth</hi> the heart upon <hi>Chriſt alone,</hi> and his Righteouſneſs held out in the Promiſes, with renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own, even with indignation in point of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The Soul is hungry after Chriſts Righteouſneſs, as moſt excellent, and loaths its own as dung and draught: Phil. 3.6, 7, 8, &amp;c. <hi>What things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt; yea, doubtleſs I count all things loſs, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my own righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> See theſe, or moſt of theſe,<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> in that gracious Convert, mentioned Luk. 15. ſet out as a patern, as a picture, and as a lively inviter, for a poor ſinner to look to, that deſires to partake of the like mercy.</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:118867:64"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith <hi>Convinceth</hi> him to be in a periſhing condition, without his Fathers love, ver. 17. <hi>And when he came to himſelf, he ſaid, How many hired ſervants of my Father have bread enough, and to spare, and I periſh with hunger.</hi> I ſay, it was Faith that wrought this ſame conviction; for it was not before he came to himſelf, that is, before he raiſed him up from his dead condition, &amp;c. Verſe the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It puts his Soul into a <hi>mourning,</hi> confeſſing frame, v. 18. <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my Father, and ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It <hi>ſubdues</hi> his heart to lay down all <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> and to take any courſe for his living, v. 19. —<hi>make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> Obſerve, he uttered not ſo much as he intended, his Father prevented him with his mercy; as Pſal 32.5. <hi>I ſaid, I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions to the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It <hi>fixeth</hi> his heart upon his Fathers mercy, not upon his own merit. Faith tells him, Though thou haſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the duty of a Son, thy Father hath not forgot the bowels of a Father. The word Father runs much in his minde: <hi>I will go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c. Here now a Spirit of Adoption begins to work, whereby he cryes, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> O dear Father! <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, &amp;c.</hi> But yet thou art my Father. This is the laſt act of juſtifying Faith, by which the Soul is put into a child-like condition, and fit to receive a childes portion of God. All is of his free grace: Jer. 3.19. <hi>And I ſaid, How ſhall I put thee among the children? Thou ſhalt call me, My Father, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the juſt lives by Faith in the <hi>work</hi> of Juſtification,<note place="margin">Vid. Cotton p. 14. &amp; D.

that he believed. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.3, 4. <hi>He believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs;</hi> which is cited out of Gen. 15.6. and ſo it appears to be after ſuch time as he was in Covenant with God, and in the ſtate of Grace. Yet ſtill his Juſtification is continued by a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act of Faith; and ſo <hi>David</hi> ſues out his Juſtification by a renewed act of Faith and Prayer, Pſal 51. though he were juſtified before.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Chriſtians are much to blame, who after they have once believed in God for Juſtification, do not labour to renew this act from day to day: and thence comes flatneſs in Spirit, and deadneſs in Duties, when we ſee not a daily need of going out of our ſelves into Chriſt. And ſurely if Chriſt applies his own ſacrifice daily to us by interceſsion with his Father. [Heb. 7.25. <hi>He ever liveth to make interceſſion for us</hi>—]</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould not we apply it daily by Faith and Prayer, that God for Chriſts ſake may <hi>forgive us our</hi> daily <hi>treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes,</hi> as we are taught to pray? And this is to live by faith in a continued act of Juſtification: Therefore it is put, not in the Preſent Tenſe, but in the Future; it is not here [doth] but he [ſhall] live by his Faith; that is, as <hi>long as he lives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take heed the blood of Chriſt run not cold in the veins of Faith; that you truſt not more to grace received, than to the fountain of grace and pardon in Chriſt. The truth is, our beſt duties ſtand in need of pardon, and our beſt graces of quickning, and nothing will quicken us more, than the aſſurance of our Juſtification. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though a mans ſpirit be without guile, and he <hi>knows nothing by himſelf</hi> (he allows himſelf in no known evil) yet even at ſuch a time,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> he is <hi>not thereby juſtified,</hi> but then, he muſt fly to Chriſt for Juſtification, and ſay, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 32.1, 2.</p>

                        </note> If a Chriſtian lives by Faith the Life of Juſtification, in applying the righteouſneſs of another, it may be matter of <hi>Humiliation.</hi> A Priſoner that is freed from Condemnation by a Pardon from the King, and not by Self-juſtification, hath cauſe to walk humbly for ever after. This is our caſe, &amp;c. It was a great ſin in <hi>Abſalom,</hi> after his Father had pardoned his Murther, and received him into favour again, and kiſſed him, the next news we hear of him, he prepares him Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and Horſes, and Men to run before him, that by ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the hearts of the people, he might ſtep up into his Fathers Throne, and thruſt him out. And ſurely it is the greateſt expreſſion of neglect and unthankfulneſſe that can be, after God hath pardoned our ſins, and received us into favour, for us to ſteal away the hearts of his people, and to ſet up our ſelves, in ſtead of magnifying the Name of God; to draw Diſciples after our own ſelves, in ſtead of drawing Diſciples after Jeſas Chriſt. It is a ſin, and a temptation, which is common to the nature of man, even the Regenerate themſelves are not out of this <hi>Gun-ſhot: Paul</hi> was in danger to be <hi>xalted above meaſure;</hi> and the great contention among the Diſciples themſelves, was <hi>Who ſhould be the greateſt?</hi> If this was the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil; and after that, the Devils <hi>Temptation</hi> upon our firſt Parents, that they might fall by Pride, as he did: I ſee not why any ſhould ſecure themſelves from this Temptation in the ſtate of grace. Therefore you that ſtand, take heed leſt you fall; though you ſhall never fall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:118867:74"/>
                        <hi>finally</hi> by this ſin, yet you may fall <hi>fearfully,</hi> if you look not well about you. And ſurely, this is one good means among the reſt, to keep us from falling to conſider. We are juſtified by the Righteouſneſſe of another. We live as pardoned men; we live upon mercy, we live upon alms. A poor creature, who (like lame <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi>) is fed at the Table of another, and clothed with the garments of another, and hath nothing that he can call his own, hath little cauſe to be proud: this is our condition. We live at Gods finding for meat, drink, and clothing, not onely for our Bodies, but for our Souls alſo, from day to day. As God hath put meat into our mouthes; ſo he puts words of prayers into our mouthes firſt: Hoſ. 14 2. <hi>Take unto you words, and ſay unto the Lord, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly:</hi> And ſo our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, &amp;c.</hi> Mark ye, here are Petitions put into our mouthes every day, as well as the firſt day of our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, both concerning giving and forgiving: though ſome are ſo proud now adayes, they know not how to ſay that Prayer. Shall Chriſt teach them how to pray, or ſhall they teach Chriſt? Is there a greater <hi>Soloeciſm,</hi> than to be proud Beggar? A <hi>Beggar,</hi> and yet proud! A <hi>Beggar,</hi> and yet one that ſcorns to beg! One whoſe <hi>wants</hi> beg, and cry aloud, and yet his <hi>tongue</hi> begs not! I know no better means to cure this pride, than the conſideration of this; We live not upon our ſelves, but upon God: the very life of our Souls, the food of our Souls, the clothing of our Souls, all is from God.</p>

                  <p>THE ſecond Part of Spiritual Life, is the Life of <hi>Sanctification:</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature. And thus the juſt lives by Faith alſo. As Faith layes hold upon Chriſt for Juſtification; ſo it draws vertue from Chriſt for Sanctification: and that either <hi>Renewing and Cleanſing,</hi> or Fructifying, Mortifying, and Vivifying, &amp;c. <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then the juſt live by Faith the life of Sanctification: for, as Faith works by Love; ſo, by Humility, Patience and other Chriſtian Graces: and ſo the Apoſtle applies this very Text, Heb. 10. where he perſwades them to <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their ſouls in patience.</hi> Yea, but how ſhall they get patience? Why, get Faith, and they ſhall be ſure to get Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and all other needful Graces: Ver. 36, 38. <hi>For ye
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118867:78"/>
have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe.</hi> Now the juſt ſhall live by Faith, ſayes he.</p>

                        </note>2. What this Sanctification is, and wherein it doth conſiſt? And it may be thus deſcribed: <q>It is an inward and powerful change of a perſon juſtified, whereby the image of God is renewed in him, by the work of the spirit.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a <hi>change,</hi> and a <hi>powerful change,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from that work that may be in a <hi>civil man,</hi> whereby his corrupt nature is <hi>ſuppreſſed,</hi> and reſtrained, though his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption be not <hi>mortified.</hi>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118867:79"/>
changed: but true grace doth ever begin at the fountain, it purifies that in the firſt place, and then the ſtreams which flow from thence, Mat. 23.25. Pſal. 51.10.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is the change of a <hi>juſtified perſon,</hi> to ſhew, that however Juſtification be not Sanctification, nor Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Juſtification; yet Sanctification is a neceſſary fruit, and an inſeparable companion of Juſtification. That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is once juſtified, is alſo ſanctified, as in the place before-named, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>form</hi> of Sanctification, conſiſts in the <hi>Renewing of Gods Image;</hi> in which Image Man was created at the firſt, having not onely a ſpiritual <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> a Soul, and ſpiritual <hi>faculties</hi> of that Soul, Reaſon and Will; but ſpiritual and divine <hi>Properties</hi> of thoſe Faculties, <hi>Light</hi> in his Reaſon, to know the Truth; a ſweet <hi>flexibility</hi> in his Will to obey the Truth, according to the Will of God. Now after the Fall, though man have the ſame Soul, and the ſame Faculties, yet he hath not the ſame divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of thoſe Faculties: for as he fell by the Devils temptation, ſo he fell into the Devils ſin and condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Devil fell by Pride he would needs be above God, or as God, &amp; ſo he tempted our firſt Parents to fall by the ſame kinde of Pride; and ever ſince, man in the ſtate of corruption, would be ſome-body in thoſe two main Faculties of his Soul, Reaſon and Will: (and therefore we are all naturally Papiſts and Arminians in this Point) his Reaſon he would lift up above the Word of God (as they do their Traditions) and his VVill above the VVill of God; whereby it come to paſs, that his Pride makes him very wilful in ſinning againſt God, Jer. 44.16. or elſe preſuming upon a falſe ſuppoſed liberty of converting himſelf to God at his own pleaſure: whereas the Apoſtle ſaith flatly, <hi>It is not in him that willeth, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is the condition of Man in the ſtate of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; the Image of God is thus fearfully defaced. Now when grace comes in the work of Sanctification, there is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118867:80"/>
preſently a change wrought, not in the very ſubſtance and faculties of the Soul, but onely in the properties of them: preſently the <hi>lofty looks of man are humbled, and the haughtineſs of men is bowed down, and the Lord alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in that day,</hi> Iſa. 2.11. There's no more, My Reaſon, but, Thy Word, Lord, ſhall be my guide; then, no more <hi>My Will:</hi> but, <hi>Thy Will be done:</hi> Let it be <hi>done in earth, as it is done in heaven;</hi> then, no more, I will do this or that by my own ſtrength; I will repent when I am old; I can convert my ſelf to God when I liſt— No: but as poor <hi>Ephraim</hi> cries out, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; convert thou me, and I ſhall be converted: for thou art the Lord my God,</hi> Jer. 31.8. Thus truth of Grace ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and it ſanctifies the <hi>Will,</hi> and ſo it ſanctifies the <hi>Affections</hi> to love God, and by conſequence, to love that which God loves, and to hate the contrary; it ſanctifies the <hi>Conſcience</hi> to accuſe, and excuſe upon juſt grounds; it ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies the <hi>Memory,</hi> to retain good things; it ſanctifies the <hi>Tongue,</hi> to ſpeak good things, or at leaſt it is pain and grief to keep ſilence (Pſal. 39.) it ſanctifies the <hi>ear</hi> to hear good things, and ſhut the door againſt the contrary; it ſanctifies the <hi>hand</hi> to do good things; it ſanctifies the <hi>feet,</hi> the feet of the Soul, to walk in good wayes. In a word, it ſanctifies the whole man to the ſervice of that God, who hath redeemed him from death. And thus the form of Sanctification, conſiſts in the renewing of the <hi>Image of God in righteouſneſs and holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.24. which implies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the defacing of the Image of old <hi>Adam,</hi> and of Satan; the pulling down of the old ſtructure of ſin, before there can be a rearing up of the new ſtructure of Grace; a <hi>putting off the old man,</hi> before there can be a <hi>putting on the new.</hi>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:118867:92"/>
Other Twins may die, at leaſt one of them; but theſe live and die together: yea, they live and never die. As <hi>Jacob</hi> took hold of the heel of his brother; ſo the Life of Sanctification follows the Life of Juſtification cloſe at the heels. 1 Cor 6 11.—<hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified</hi>— As you cannot ſeparate the light of the fire from the heat thereof; no more can you ſeparate the <hi>light</hi> of Faith in Juſtification, from the <hi>heat</hi> of Faith in Sanctification. Mat 3.11. —<hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And yet, I ſay, Papiſts on the one ſide, and Carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors on the other ſide, ſeperate theſe two precious Lives, or at leaſt they would cauſe one of theſe Siſter-Twins to devour the other. The Papiſts make Sanctification to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour Juſtification; and the Carnal Profeſſor makes Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to devour Sanctification.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, the Papiſts make Sanctification to devour Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For, they ſay, in effect, Our Sanctification is our Juſtification. For, they ſay, to juſtifie, is onely to make juſt by inherent Righteouſneſs. Again, they make Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſin not to be the <hi>Pardon</hi> of ſin, but the utter <hi>dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or expulſion of ſin by infuſion of Righteouſneſs; as darkneſs is expell'd by light, and cold by heat.</p>
                        <p>Thus they make Juſtification wholly to conſiſt in the parts of Sanctification: For whereas Sanctification is partly <hi>Privative,</hi> which we call Mortification; and partly <hi>Poſitive,</hi> which we call Vivification; which is either <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Vide Down p. 50. Papiſts make ſanctification to devour ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. Carnal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors <hi>è contr.</hi>

                        <p>On the other ſide, Carnal Profeſſors, they make Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to devour Sanctification.

But you ſee this Errour confuted. There is a Sanctification in Gods people inherent, beſides that which is in Chriſt. The juſt lives by Faith the Life of Sanctification.

theſe two Aſſertions. Though they differ not much in words, yet they differ much in ſenſe. There is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt <hi>Fide Solâ,</hi> and <hi>Fide Solitariâ;</hi> Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and Faith that is alone.

So Faith alone, through Chriſt, obtains the life of Juſtification but not Faith as alone in the perſon, for it is ever attended with good works, that are witneſſes of that life. Or as a man that is guided in his way by the benefit of a Torch; he is onely guided by the light of the fire: but that is never alone, for it is accompanied with heat: So a Chriſtian man, he is guided in his way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the light of the knowledge of Chriſt through Faith: but the light is never alone for it is ever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the heat of love; Gal. 5.6. <hi>Faith works by love.</hi> Therefore they slander, when they affirm we teach the contrary: For we teach, That a Chriſtian lives the life of Sanctification and Fructification in many powerful and quickning Conſiderations.

It is ſomething that is ſinful; he muſt not fight with his own ſhadow. <hi>The body of ſin</hi> muſt be deſtroyed; Rom. 6.6 <hi>The law of ſin and death aboliſh'd,</hi> Rom. 8.2. God ſees ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and an enlightned Soul ſees ſomething that is to be mortified, and fights with ſome-body. Col. 3.5.

And though we do not ſay, we muſt thus prepare <hi>our ſelves;</hi> yet we may ſafely ſay, <hi>God</hi> thus prepares his people for Chriſt.

                     <p>THE juſt lives by Faith the Life of <hi>Vivification.</hi> When his heart is ready to ſink, Faith lifts it up again, and puts a new Life as it were into it: And the very <hi>Text</hi> ſeems to drive at this alſo, if we make out the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> or oppoſition to the full be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Unbelief and Faith. The Unbeliever lifts up his heart, in <hi>Creature-ſtrength;</hi> but the Believer lives by Faith in <hi>Gods ſtrength. Jehoſaphats</hi> heart was <hi>lift up in the wayes of the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.6. In the midſt of all damps, he liv'd by Faith this Life of Vivification:
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118867:107"/>
which is as it were (under God) the <hi>life</hi> of our lives, or at leaſt the <hi>livelineſs</hi> of our life; as we ſay, Such an one is a lively Chriſtian, or a man full of life. For I do not here mean by Vivification, the <hi>firſt</hi> quickning work of the Spirit (for that we ſpoke of before, in the Life of Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) but I mean the quickning and reviving work of the Spirit, after ſome <hi>deadneſs</hi> hath ſeized upon the Soul.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Cauſes of this deadneſs.</note>A Chriſtians deadneſs, is either Accidental, Sinful, Penal, or Probational.</p>

In which caſes, a man may have a very good will to do ſervice with life and activity: but bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pulling him down, and the natural ſpirits being low, he is juſt like a Bird that hath her wings clipt, who would fain fly, but cannot. And this unfits to any duties, as well natural and civil, as religious.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Sinful</hi> deadneſs,<note place="margin">2. Sinful.</note> when a man hath little heart or affection to the ſervice of God. And if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the reaſon of this, it ſprings from ſinful cauſes: Which are either <hi>Privative,</hi> as the want of good <hi>Food,</hi> the Word, which is <hi>animae pabulum:</hi> Or good <hi>Exerciſe;</hi> 1 Tim. 4.7. <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf rather unto godlineſs:</hi> Or good <hi>Company,</hi> which is quickning; one ſtick of this fire kindles another; he that's all alone ſoon falls aſleep: Or good <hi>Air,</hi> I mean, a good Miniſtery.<note place="margin">Heb. 10.24, 25</note> As the preſence of theſe things in nature, makes men active and vigorous, and the want of them, makes heavy and dead: ſo in Grace.</p>
                     <p>Or elſe they are <hi>Poſitive</hi> cauſes. And ſuch are 1. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive cares</hi> or pleaſures, which do <hi>overcharge</hi> the heart, Luke 21.34. 2. <hi>Bad Company: Peters</hi> heart was deaded in the High-Prieſts Hall. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Nero,</hi> he tied the bodies of living men to thoſe that were dead; which was cold comfort, and half a death to them. Nothing dulls more, than the ſociety of dull and dead-hearted men. 3. <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in Sin, which makes inſenſible in ſinning. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.34, 35. <hi>They have ſtricken me, and I was not ſick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not, &amp;c.</hi> 4. <hi>Satan</hi> oft rocks the cradle. It was more than a natural drowzineſs, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were ſo heavy and ſleepy, when Chriſt was upon his Paſſion.

                     <p>That, at ſuch times as theſe, the juſt <hi>lives by faith,</hi> and by Faith recovers the quickneſs and activity of his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life again.

                        </gap>, to thrive, or <hi>rekindle</hi> it, to blow it up as <hi>a spark</hi> into a flame. Now Faith is as the bellows to blow it up. The breath of the Lord indeed is the wind that breathes upon dead bones, ſo upon dead Souls: But Faith is as the bellows, that draws this wind, and blows it forth again. And therefore if you obſerve it, the Apoſtles Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation [to <hi>ſtir up,</hi> or <hi>blow up</hi> the gift] is grounded upon the former verſe <hi>viz. I call to minde the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy grandmother Lois, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Thou that haſt faith, art too blame, if thou doſt not ſtir up the gift that is in thee, (Miniſterial gifts eſpecially) by the exerciſe of thy faith.</p>

You know poor Bees, and other Flies, if they can creep into the Sun, it quickens them, and puts a new life into them. So the Chickens that hang the wing, get under the warmth of the Hen. The nearer we preſs to Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, the more ſpiritual life and heat. He is the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs, that ariſes with healing in his wings,</hi> Mal. 4.2. The beams of his grace revive the drooping Soul: as ſhe ſaid, Joh. 11. <hi>If thou hadſt been
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:118867:113"/>
here, my brother had not died; but I know thou art able to raiſe him up again:</hi> So may a Chriſtian ſay, If thou hadſt been here, my Soul had not died, not been in this dead and ſad condition; but thou canſt quicken it again. Faith draws quickning vertue from Jeſus Chriſt, as we heard before in the Reaſon.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. Ordinances.</note>The ſecond Means are quickning <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which are as <hi>beams</hi> from the <hi>Sun.</hi> One of theſe Ordinances is a <hi>quickning Miniſtery;</hi> this puts life into the Soul. The Word of God is compared to <hi>fire:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. Word.</note> and therefore <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>burning and ſhining light,</hi> Joh. 5.35. A <hi>ſhining</hi> light; ſo he taught the people: A <hi>burning</hi> light; ſo he quickned, <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us,</hi> ſaid the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> Luke 24.32. <hi>while he talked with us, and opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> The Miniſters <hi>lips</hi> are as <hi>fire,</hi> Peoples <hi>hearts</hi> as <hi>tinder. Eliſha</hi> liv'd in a dead time, and therefore he praid for a double meaſure of the Spirit of <hi>Elijah,</hi> which was an active, powerful Spirit, that he might quicken the people If the Miniſters lips be touched with a <hi>Coal from</hi> Gods <hi>Altar,</hi> they do oft inflame the hearts of the hearers. Live under ſuch a Miniſtery, if thou wouldſt be quickned. A lively Miniſtery makes a lively people; a dead Miniſtery makes a dead-hearted people. And therefore it's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.1.</note> that the deadneſs of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> is charged upon the <hi>Angel</hi> or Miniſter of the Church; <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the Angel of the Church of Sardis, write, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore pray for your Miniſters, that themſelves being quickned, they may quicken you. Another quickning Ordinance is <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2. Prayer. Pſal. 119.</note> How oft doth <hi>David</hi> pray for quickning grace? five or ſix times in one Pſalm. He begins many a Prayer with an heavy heart; and before he hath done, he is full of life. Therefore pray much, becauſe all life is from God, and he quickens whom he will. Onely let me adde this Caution,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> before I let this paſs, Be ſure thy underſtanding and affection go along together in every Ordinance, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:118867:113"/>
in every part of the Ordinance, as thou wouldſt have it a quickning Ordinance. Many complain they are dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ordinances: and no wonder: They hear, and they pray without underſtanding, or without affection. It is a Rule, <hi>Quicquid agit, agit per contactum:</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thing acts effectually upon another, it is by ſome kinde of touch or cloſe. When our Souls do not cloſe with the duty in Prayer or Hearing no marvel if it put no life into us. When we give way to diſtractions, to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts, to wandring looks, &amp;c. we do but take Gods Name in vain, and the Ordinance is vain to us.

And to this increaſe of Spiritual Life, the Prophet alludes in the very Context of this Chapter, ver. 14. <hi>The earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea:</hi> Which words, howſoever ſome do refer to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Gods glory, in the deſtruction of the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans (which is true alſo) yet others extend them further, even to the abundant pouring forth of the Spirit of grace, (as a fruit of their affliction.) So the very ſame words are uſed iſa. 11.9. where he ſhews, how ſuch men as have been <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Leopards,</hi> ſhall be made of a <hi>Lamb-like</hi> diſpoſition: And how ſo? <hi>For the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> So that theſe words do neceſſarily refer to the abundant increaſe of grace; and ſo the juſt lives by Faith the Life of Augmentation in the Winter of Affliction. As the unbeliever ſwells at firſt <hi>[ebullat,]</hi> but vaniſhes to nothing afterwards: So the believer is ſmall at firſt, but increaſeth exceedingly.

Therefore, where Chriſt bid the young man, <hi>Go ſell all,</hi> Mat. 19.21. he proves he was not ſo well grown in grace, as he took himſelf to be: Yea, ſuch as had truth

It may be the very <hi>ſmell</hi> of the meat offends his dainry ſtomach, and ſo he riſes up from the Table, and <hi>turns his back</hi> upon the Ordinances: Whereas a growing Chriſtian feeds hard upon a plain diſh, he can well digeſt plain Preaching; he inquires not how <hi>toothſom,</hi> but how <hi>whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome</hi> his meat is.

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118867:125"/>
he hath it, it does him little good. As I have heard the ſtory of a Scholar, who falling ſick many miles from his College, had a great minde the Cook ſhould be ſent for to prepare him a diſh: Accordingly he came, and prepared it; when the Scholar had it, he could eat none. O ſays he, this is none of the <hi>College-broth:</hi> Nay, ſaid the Cook, you have not your <hi>College-ſtomach.</hi> So it is with many Chriſtians now adayes, who formerly had a notable ſtomach to the Word; now, they muſt have ſuch or ſuch a Cook to dreſs it, or elſe none will down; and when they have what they deſire, they feed not, they grow not as they were wont to do, becauſe they have not the ſtomach they were wont to have. And truly, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues little grace, and much carnality in a Chriſtian: 1 Cor. 3.4. <hi>For while one ſaith, I am of Paul, and I am of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos, are ye not carnal?</hi> Note the phraſe, Luk. 1.70. <hi>As God ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. there's <hi>Prophets</hi> in the plural Number, and <hi>Mouth</hi> in the ſingular; as if all the Prophets had but <hi>one mouth.</hi> Therefore as God <hi>speaks</hi> by the mouth of all his Prophets, we ſhould <hi>hear</hi> from the mouth of all the Prophets: As they ſpeak as it were with a <hi>ſingle mouth,</hi> ſo we ſhould hear with a <hi>ſingle ear;</hi> not ſinfully <hi>preferring one before another,</hi> while they all ſpeak the ſame truth. This was <hi>Ahabs</hi> fault, his falſe Prophets muſt dreſs all his diſhes; there was but one <hi>faithful Cook (Micaiah)</hi> and he cries out againſt him, as if <hi>death</hi> had been <hi>in the pot, I hate him,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for he does not propheſie good unto me, but evil.</hi> Whereas all the fault was in the ſtomach, not in the Cook; <hi>Micaiah</hi> was not an <hi>evil speaker,</hi> but <hi>Ahab</hi> was an <hi>evil hearer,</hi> full of prejudice, and full of partiality.</p>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the clog of his own ſinful corruptions, which hang heavy upon him, (for <hi>the Fleſh</hi> is ever <hi>luſting againſt the Spirit</hi>) and yet he grows; In ſpight of Satan, <hi>the Prince of the Air,</hi>

And how comes this to paſs? Surely you will ſay, here is <hi>aliquid Dei,</hi> the finger of God muſt needs be in it. The preſervation of Grace in this caſe, is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. If you ſhould ſee a Ruſh-candle ſet without doors in the midſt of ſtormy Winds and Rain, and yet continue light, you would ſtand and look upon it with admiration; and yet thus is the little Candle of Grace preſerved.

There are Arguments on both ſides: Some conceiving, glory ſhall be equal, becauſe the Merit of Chriſt is equal; Therefore in the Parable of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, he that laboured moſt received no more, than he that laboured the ſhorteſt time; every man receives <hi>his penny,</hi> Mat. 20. But the Parable cannot be meant of eternal life; for there are no <hi>murmurers</hi> in heaven, ſuch as you finde in the Parable, that murmured becauſe they had no more. But that other Parable in the 19 of <hi>Luke,</hi> doth rather ſet forth the ſtate of glory, upon the return of the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, where he that gained moſt, received moſt reward; he that gained ten talents, was made ruler over ten Cities; and he that gained five, was made ruler over five. Yet this doth not infer merit of Works neither, but a gracious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in God, to encourage his ſervants in a way of well-doing.

They ſhould grow twice as faſt, bring forth twice as many Lambs, twice as much Wooll, twice as much Milk, as thoſe that go upon bare Commons. All the world may cry ſhame on ſuch a man that is <hi>high fed,</hi> and often fed with fat and ſweet Ordinances, if he be ſtill like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> lean Kine, as lean and ill-favoured as ever he was before. Certainly, fat Ordinances and lean Souls do not well agree. We are to look upon it as the greateſt of Judgements, to have (as Pſal. 106.15.) <hi>leanneſs ſent into our ſouls,</hi> while we are fed with <hi>Manna.</hi> We look on it as an affliction, to have an over-lean Body; but it's a far ſadder condition, to have a lean Soul. Of the two, it were much better to have a well-thriving Soul, and a lean Body, than a well-thriving Body, and a lean Soul: it is a great mercy when both proſper, 3 Joh. 2. <hi>I wiſh above all things, that thou maiſt prosper, and be in health, as thy ſoul prospereth.</hi> Oh it is a ſweet thing, eſpecially to have a proſpering Soul, and ſtill upon the growing hand: and God expects it ſhould be ſo, where he affords good diet, great means of grace; as Dan. 1.10. <hi>The Prince of the Eunuchs ſaid to Daniel, I fear my Lord the King, who hath appointed your meat and your drink, if you ſhould

look ill,</hi> who fare ſo well, <hi>I ſhould be ſure to bear the blame;</hi> it were as much as my head is worth. So certainly, where God affords precious food for precious Souls, if theſe Souls be lean under fat Ordinances, either thoſe that are fed, or thoſe that feed them; either the Stewards, or the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; either Miniſter or people, or both, are ſure to bear the blame. It is but equal and juſt that ſuch ſhould grow. We do not wonder to ſee lean Sheep upon bare Commons; but when we ſee Sheep continue lean in fat Paſtures, we think their meat is ill beſtowed on them: and therefore let us ſtrive to be on the growing hand.</p>

We have every way greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: we do not onely ſtand upon the ſhoulders of our Forefathers Examples and Experiences, but we have (or may have) more Spirit within us alſo. Indeed, in regard of <hi>bodily</hi> ſtature, the firſt age brought forth <hi>Giants,</hi> and the laſt <hi>Dwarfs:</hi> But in regard of <hi>Spiritual</hi> growth, it was prophecied, the laſt ages ſhould bring forth the <hi>Giants,</hi> in compariſon of the former: Zech. 12.8.—<hi>He that is feeble among them, at that day ſhall be as David, and the houſe of David ſhall be as God, as the Angel of the Lord before

A man indeed may grow too great in other things; but there is no danger of exceeding in this growth. And yet it is ſtrange to ſee, how little Chriſtians affect this better kinde of growth. They will ſay, They have Knowledge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and Grace enough: but one ſhall hear few ſay, I am rich enough, and ſtrong enough, and honourable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Men love growth in their bodies, in their eſtates, in their children, yea, growth in their cattel and trees: Oh how do they rejoyce to ſee them grow well, and come forwards? and why ſhould we not much more love growth in our Souls? For a man may grow too great in other things, but there is no danger of exceeding in this growth. A man may grow too exceeding tall, he may become a Monſter; he may grow too fat, he may grow to be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to himſelf; he may grow too rich, as well as too poor: Therefore ſayes <hi>Agur, Give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient,</hi> Prov. 308.

They can never loſe <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 10.28.<note place="margin">Seven things never loſt.</note> Chriſt ſaith of his Sheep, <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hands:</hi> and therefore it is ſaid, Joh. 5.24. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, hath everlaſting life, and ſhall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but is paſſed from death to life.</hi> He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, hath eternal life already, as <hi>he that believes not, is condemned already,</hi> Joh. 3.19.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They ſhall never loſe <hi>Confirming Grace:</hi> In ſome degree they may, but not as to the ſecuring of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate and ſtation in Chriſt; 1 Cor 1.8. <hi>Who alſo ſhall confirm you to the end:</hi> Pſal. 94.14. The Lord will not <hi>caſt off</hi> his people, nor <hi>forſake</hi> his inheritance.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They ſhall never loſe <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſins</hi> paſt, and repented of, Jer. 31.34. <hi>For I will forgive their iniquity, and remember their ſin no more.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. They ſhall never loſe the <hi>Seed of Grace,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>His ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, for he is born of God.</hi> He doth not loſe <hi>that,</hi> but it ſtill remaineth in him. It is noted of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 2, 3. when he had loſt all his Cattel, his Servants, his Children, all his Temporal goods, yet he kept his Spirituals in ſpight of Satan, he kept <hi>his integrity;</hi> he will ſooner part with his life,<note place="margin">Job 27.2.</note> than part with that. As it is with a man at Sea in a great ſtorm, when all is caſt over-board, the very Corn that feeds him, the very Clothes that cover his nakedneſs, yet he makes much of his life, he ſwims to the ſhore with <hi>that,</hi> though he loſe all the reſt: So it is with a gracious perſon, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he loſes in Troubles and Tentations, he ſhall never loſe the ſeed of grace. We may ſay of him, as <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 20.10. Trouble not your ſelves, for <hi>his life is in him.</hi>
                        </p>

from whence this grace ſprings: As God promiſed he <hi>would not take his Spirit from Solomon, as he took it from Saul,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.14, 15. So Chriſt hath promiſed he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wholly take away his good Spirit from his Elect, but it ſhall <hi>abide</hi> with them for ever. Joh. 14.16 He prays for a <hi>Comforter</hi> for them, <hi>that ſhould abide with them for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. They ſhall not loſe the <hi>habit of Faith,</hi> Luke 22.32. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> Though <hi>Peter</hi> loſt the acting of Faith, yet not the habit, that ceas'd not: as a man in ſleep loſeth the acts of Seeing, Hearing, Speaking, but not the habit; ſo a Chriſtian in Tentations, may loſe the acts, but not the habit of Faith.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. They never loſe their <hi>

If <hi>Adam</hi> had cauſe to be thankful to God, for making him in his own Image, placing him in Paradiſe, and giving him dominion over all creatures; how much more have the Faithful cauſe to be thankful, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated in a better condition of happineſs, than either <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, or the Angels in Heaven before their Fall: For however it is true, their condition was very happy and glorious, yet it was <hi>mutable,</hi> they might fall, and fall they did; and we finde by woful experience to this day, the mortal wounds and bruiſes that cleave to the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> through his Fall. But God (I ſay) hath inſtated the faithful in a better condition, that though in themſelves they are weak creatures, yet through his proviſion for their ſecurity, they ſhall never totally fall from the grace of Regeneration. And therefore, if we ought to be thankful for outward mercies of health, wealth, liberty, peace, and the like, which at beſt are very fading, like the <hi>flower of the field,</hi> (How ſoon may a mans health

How thankful then ſhould we be to that God, who freely beſtows upon us not a <hi>livelyhood</hi> onely, but even <hi>life</hi> it ſelf. And what life? not of Nature onely, but of Grace alſo; not Temporal, but Eternal: Pſa. 21 24. <hi>He asked life, and thou gaveſt it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</hi> We prize lives according to their duration; ſome creatures, they ſay, are born, and die again the ſame day, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of little account: But we prize thoſe moſt, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longeſt.

                        <p>There are four main Diſcouragements incident to a Chriſtian in his earthly Pilgrimage.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The inconſtancy of Creatures towards Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Creatures inconſtancy towards God</p>
                        <p n="3">3. A mans weakneſs, compared with the ſtrength of enemies oppoſing.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A mans own ſinful Demerits, daily forfeiting all his Mercies.</p>
                        <p>To which adde,</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The uncertainty of future Events.</p>
                        <p>But this Doctrine, that <hi>the juſt lives by faith the life of Perſeverance,</hi> is a great Incouragement againſt all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>The inconſtancy of the Creature.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1. In the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the Creature in it ſelf.</note> Job 6.15 <hi>Job</hi> complains, his friends had forſaken him <hi>like a deceitful brook,</hi> that is full in raining times, when there is no want of water; and empty and dry in Summer heat, or when there is greateſt need. For a man ſhall have many friends, ſo long as God rains down ſhowers of bleſſings from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon him: but if God once ſearch him with the <hi>fiery trial</hi> of ſome ſuch Judgement, as dries up all his ſubſtance, he ſhall hardly finde a drop of comfort from ſuch, as in time of proſperity did run in a full current of kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Well, ſuppoſe it be ſo, yet this is great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to a poor Believer, when he can thus reaſon; Well, though my friends leave me upon earth, yet Faith aſſures me,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> I have a friend in heaven that will <hi>not forſake me,</hi> who doth uſually let out moſt of himſelf to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they have the leaſt of Creature-comforts; he
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:118867:152"/>
delights to viſit his people in <hi>Egypt;</hi> in the <hi>fiery Furnace.</hi> His Servant <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Patmos; Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the Priſon, when they had little or no comfort from the Creature? And what is Heaven, but the Preſence God? Where there is moſt abſence of the Creature, <hi>viz.</hi> in Heaven, where there is neither <hi>marriage, nor giving in marriage;</hi> neither buying, nor ſelling, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing, nor rejoycing in the earthly Comforts of this life; yet there is joy enough for all that, when there is no Creature-comfort at all:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> God himſelf ſhall be <hi>all in all.</hi> And if the Preſence of God it ſelf alone, ſhall be enough to make Heaven, when all the world ſhall be left, am I not bound to believe Gods Perſon is enough upon earth, if all Creatures ſhould forſake me? If I can live by Faith the Life of Perſeverance, in reſpect of influence from God, what if I do not live by Senſe the Life of Perſeverance, in reſpect of influence from Creatures? The former is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough of it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2. Creature-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</note>Secondly, The ſecond great Diſcouragement, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed greater than the former, is this, <hi>The Creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy towards God.</hi> The Creatures goodneſs, is as <hi>the morning dew,</hi> Hoſ 6.4. that is ſoon gone. O how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are they <hi>turned out of the way,</hi> ſaith God, Judg 2.17. <hi>Peter</hi> is ready to ſwear Allegeance to his Maſter, and as ready almoſt to forſwear with the ſame breath; and do not think that thou haſt a better heart than <hi>Peter</hi> had: for, as in <hi>water, face anſwers to face;</hi> ſo <hi>the heart of man to man,</hi> Prov. 27.19. One face is not more like another, repreſented in water or in glaſs, then one mans heart is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally like another's: All are very fickle, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant in the love and ſervice of God. Now this is ſometimes a great Diſcouragement to a gracious Soul.</p>
                        <p>Saith ſuch a Soul, I have ſuch a baſe backſliding heart, I ſhall never be able to hold out to the end: what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me?</p>
                        <p>For thy anſwer, Beware of Diſcouragement: though
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:118867:152"/>
thou art unconſtant and unbelieving, yet God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and he hath promiſed to make thee conſtant and faithful, or at leaſt to heal thy unconſtancy and unbelief: 2 Tim. 2.13. <hi>If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful, he cannot deny himſelf?</hi> What? if we believe not at all? that's not the meaning of it: For he gives Faith, when he intend Mercy; but if there be intermiſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions in our Faith or at leaſt in the activity of our Faith, yet God is faithful to <hi>heal our back-ſlidings, and to love us freely,</hi> Hoſ. 14.4. And this is a great Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Gods conſtancy in Covenant, oppoſed to our fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inconſtancy: He will ſo <hi>put his fear into our hearts,</hi> as we <hi>ſhall never</hi> utterly <hi>depart from him,</hi> Jerem. 32.40.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, A third Diſcouragement,<note place="margin">3. In our own weakneſs.</note> is our own <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as well as our own <hi>Inconſtancy:</hi> yea, were we never ſo conſtant in our reſolutions, yet how weak are we in our performances? We are weak, our enemies ſtrong, our trials many and great; and this is a great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a gracious heart, that howſoever <hi>the Spirit is willing, yet the fleſh is weak,</hi> that ſhould God leave us to ourſelves, we ſhould fall away from him every day: in which reſpect, Chriſt commands us, to <hi>watch and pray, leſt we enter into temptation.</hi> Mat 26.41.</p>
                        <p>Well, be it ſo, that a Chriſtian is ſo weak on the one ſide, and his enemies ſo ſtrong on the other, yet Faith ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters this notable incouragement, in the ſight and ſenſe of all our enemies and greateſt infirmities. 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>But God is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that which you are able to bear, but will with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation alſo make a way to eſcape:</hi> and ſo the weakeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, if a true believer, ſhall be <hi>kept by the power of God,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>I know in whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his truſt againſt that day.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The fourth Diſcouragement,<note place="margin">4. Againſt ſinful diſtempers.</note> is a mans own
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:118867:153"/>
ſinful <hi>Diſtempers,</hi> daily forfeiting all his Mercies. <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. 94.6. There is ſo much earthlineſs in our Spirits, ſo much vanity in our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo much deadneſs in our Duties, that we do enough every day to deſerve, that God ſhould ſtrip us of his grace, and caſt us out of his Preſence for ever. Well, be it ſo, there's the incouragement, Faith aſſures us, though we deſerve no better, yet Chriſt deſerved better; he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that God ſhould continue his love and favour to us to the end. This he hath merited, and this he prays for, That <hi>they may be kept for ever,</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, as many as are <hi>given him,</hi> Joh. 17.11. And this Chriſt is <hi>able to ſave to the utmoſt all thoſe that come to God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.25.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">5. Uncertainty of future Events. 1 Cor. 10.</note>The fifth Diſcouragement, is, <hi>The uncertainty of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events.</hi> True, a believer may ſay, There hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>no Temptation taken me,</hi> but <hi>ſuch as is common to man;</hi> other men have been in as bad a condition as I am in: but alas!

It may be I may be afflicted and tempted, as never man was; It may be I may fall into ſuch ſins, as yet never any of Gods people have faln into, and it may be ſuch Judgements may befal me, as never yet befel any of Gods people; and may I not then forſake God, and God forſake me?

                           <hi>Thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth:</hi> Or,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:118867:153"/>
as others interpret it, Thou knoweſt not what is the way of the <hi>Spirit of man;</hi> that is, thou knoweſt not what are his thoughts, what is in his minde, God onely is the <hi>ſearcher of the heart;</hi> the Devil himſelf cannot know the heart of man, but by ſome external expreſſions; much leſs then canſt thou know the minde of God, what God means to do with thee the next year, or the next day: which is very elegantly ſet forth by another ſimilitude, <hi>Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with childe; even ſo thou knoweſt not the work of God, who maketh all.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, If thou doſt not know what ſo nearly concerns thy ſelf, thy very natural being, and that whereof thou maiſt be (under God) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the natural or material cauſe; how much leſs then canſt thou underſtand that which is more remote and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual? If thou doſt not know what is in the natural womb, for that is laid up amongſt the Secrets of God, Pſa. 139.15, 16. <hi>Onely thine eyes,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, did ſee my ſubſtance, when I was made in ſecret;</hi> How then ſhalt thou know what is in the <hi>Womb</hi> of the next year, or of the next day? for ſuch a phraſe you reade of in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Prov. 27.1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth:</hi> Jam. 4.13. <hi>Go to now, ye that ſay, To day, or to morrow we will go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a City, and continue there a year, and buy and ſell, and get gain: whereas ye know not what ſhall be on the morrow:</hi> You know not what ſhall appear to come forth of the womb of the morning. Gods purpoſes from eternity, are the <hi>conceptions</hi> of all productions of Providences, that are as it were the <hi>births</hi> of ſeveral days and years. Our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes oftentimes (and that without God) are falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, they bring forth <hi>a lie:</hi> But Gods purpoſes are ever true conceptions, they never miſcarry. Prov. 19.21. <hi>There are many devices in a mans heart, but the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall</hi> ever <hi>ſtand.</hi> But alas! how ſhall I know what is the minde and counſel of God, and the

way he will go in? How ſhall I know the womb of the morning? I little know what birth the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may travel with; what Sin, or what Judgement it may bring forth. It may be, when I ſhall ſay, <hi>Peace, peace,</hi> then may <hi>ſudden diſtreſs come</hi> upon me, as travail upon a woman with childe, that I ſhall no way eſcape. True in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if thou wert an unbeliever, it might be ſo; but if thou art a true believer, thou haſt a <hi>Promiſe</hi> for future Events, as thou haſt <hi>Security</hi> for what is paſt: and <hi>that,</hi> both in reſpect of ſin and affliction.</p>

He hath <hi>no form nor comelineſs, there is no beauty in him</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> The <hi>Comforts</hi> of a Chriſtian are <hi>real,</hi> but not always viſible; and therefore it is called, <hi>The hidden Manna,</hi> Rev. 2.17.

up our Sails againſt them ſometimes, and yet cannot ſee them. The Sun it ſelf is ſo viſible that it makes all things elſe viſible; and yet when it is under a Cloud, though we then ſee all other things by the light of it, yet we cannot ſee the Sun it ſelf. As in <hi>Paul</hi>'s dangerous voyage, <hi>neither Sun nor Star appeared for many days together,</hi> Acts 27 20. The rich <hi>Mines</hi> of Silver and Gold, and the ſtreams of precious Rivers, they run ſometimes <hi>under the earth</hi> many miles, and no eye takes notice of them. How near was <hi>Hagars</hi> Well of Water,<note place="margin">Gen: 21.19.</note> and yet ſhe ſaw it not, till God had opened her eyes? <hi>Peter</hi> was really delivered out of Priſon by the Angel, but for a good while together, while he looked upon Creatures, he thought it had not been true, but that he had <hi>ſeen a Viſion,</hi> or Repreſentation of ſuch a matter, Acts 12.9. The Mountain where <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſtood, was full of Horſes and Chariots, but his Servant ſaw no ſuch matter, till he was faint to pray, <hi>Lord open his eyes, that he may ſee,</hi> 2 King. 6.17. And doubtleſs it is thus in Spiritual reſpects. There may be many ſtrong influences from God upon the Souls of his Servants, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not; many eminent ſupports in their trials, which they take no notice of: They take notice of the hand that caſt them down, but they do not take notice of the hand that holds them up. <hi>Job</hi> took notice of Gods afflicting hand, but he did not take ſo much notice of Gods ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting hand, till the affliction was over. And ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. 31.22. <hi>I ſaid, I am cut off from before thine eyes.</hi> He ſpeaks like a man forſaken of God: but what follows? <hi>Nevertheleſs, thou heardeſt the voice of my ſupplications, when I cried unto thee.</hi> Obſerve, God was nearer than he was aware of. As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of his ſolitary journey to <hi>Padan-Aram, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not,</hi> Gen. 28.16. God is nearer to his Servants many times, than they are aware of: ſo as they may ſay with <hi>Job,</hi> Job 9.11. <hi>Lo, he goeth by me, and I ſee him not; he paſſeth on alſo, but I perceive him not.</hi> The poor childe

And it may be the Mother ſtands behinde the back of the childe, onely ſhe hides herſelf, to try the affection of the childe: So the poor Soul cries after God and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, Oh my Father, my Father! where is my heavenly Father!

Thus it is with many a gracious Soul though God ſpeaks <hi>home</hi> to their hearts in his Word, and they ſpeak to him by prayer, and they cannot ſay, but the Spirit <hi>helps their infirmities;</hi> yet they complain for want of his Preſence, as if there were nothing of God in them.</p>

So reaſon another ſort, The Lord hath forſaken me, or elſe I ſhould never be ſo poor!

Surely the Lord hath forſaken me, ſaith another, or elſe I ſhould never be ſo friendleſs; <hi>Lovers and friends haſt thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkneſs.</hi> And this was <hi>Jobs</hi> argument, he confeſſes God was ſometimes gracious to him, but now he looks at him as an enemy: And why ſo? becauſe he was under his afflicting hand; he had ſtript him of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mercies, Job 13.24.

                        <hi>as by the Spirit of our God.</hi> He lives by Faith the Life of Conſolation. And indeed, this is the proper uſe and effect of Faith, to rejoyce the heart; though not always an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:118867:161"/>
effect, eſpecially to our ſenſe and feeling; yet we may ſafely ſay, The ſeed of Peace, and the ſeed of Joy, is ſown in the heart, ſo ſoon as ever a man believeth. Pſal. 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and joyful glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the upright in heart;</hi> though it may be he reaps the full Harveſt many a year after. There is firſt the ſprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then the blade, and then the ear, and after that the full Corn in the ear, Mar. 4.28. And look as it is in the riſing of the Sun, though there be light at the firſt in ſome meaſure, yet there is but a little light, and leſs heat, in compariſon of that which follows: So in the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtations of the Sun of Righteouſneſs to the Soul, there is ſome light of knowledge, and ſome heat of comfort at the very firſt, but little in compariſon of that which ſhall be: And therefore the juſt lives by Faith, in expectation of a glorious <hi>Noon-tide</hi> of Peace and joy to follow after; and in the mean time, the more he increaſeth his Faith, the more he increaſeth his Joy. You may eaſily ſee it in your ſelves and others. It is poſſible a perſon may be both ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and ſanctified; he may live both theſe lives, and yet for the preſent he may be much to ſeek in his comfort, in his own ſenſe and apprehenſion; he may be in ſad, and as it were in a dead condition, for want of comfort; and therefore in due time, by the exerciſe of Faith, God addes to both the former, the Life of Conſolation, which is more properly called <hi>Life.</hi> Indeed it is the very Life of our lives: for what is life without comfort, but a <hi>living death?</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> had taſted of the forbidden fruit, he did not die preſently, if we take it in a ſtrict ſenſe; but he was made ſubject to all diſeaſes, and all kinde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, which is all one as if he had been dead: it is a <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.31. Whereas on the other ſide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy, is called Life in Scripture phraſe; they are uſed promiſcuouſly, ſometimes Life is put for Joy, and Joy is put for Life, as if they were all one: Pſal. 30.5. <hi>In thy favour is life; heavineſs may endure for a night, but
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:118867:161"/>
joy cometh in the morning.</hi> All one, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Life</hi> comes in the morning, according to the former expreſſion, <hi>In thy favour is life.</hi> The Philoſophers have a Poſition; <q>Nec voluptas ſine vitâ, nec vita ſine voluptate:</q> Pleaſure cannot be without life, nor life without ſome kinde of pleaſure. And it is true in Divinity, he onely deſerves the name of a living man, who injoys ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his life. And indeed, <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Eternal Joy:</hi> For otherwiſe, the wicked ſhall live eternally, if we take the word in the largeſt ſenſe; but their Eternal Life, is called Eternal Death, becauſe they live not in <hi>Joy,</hi> but <hi>Miſery.</hi> So that it's clear, to live, moſt properly, is to live <hi>comfortably:</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.3 <hi>Now we live, if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord.</hi> We <hi>live,</hi> how is that? Did not the Apoſtle live both the life of Nature and the life of Grace, whether the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> ſhould ſtand or fall? Without all queſtion he did: but his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, Now we live comfortably, if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord: which life, is onely worth the name of a life. So that when it is ſaid, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith;</hi> the meaning is, he ſhall live a ſweet and comfortable life, whatever his outward troubles may be; he ſhall not want ſweet ſupports and comforts within; he ſhall, even <hi>then,</hi> live by his Faith. And that this is the ſenſe of the Text in the latitude of it, ſeems to be clear by the oppoſite mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; as the Life of Gods People is oppoſed to the Life of the Caldeans (their enemies) and ſo the Joy of the one to the Joy of the other. Their enemies have a kinde of ſuperficial flaſhing joy, ariſing from the immoderate uſe or abuſe of the Creature; and this joy tickles them, or puffs them up for the preſent. In which reſpect, the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean is compared to a drunken man, who, you know, thinks himſelf the onely merry man in the world; he is merry as <hi>Cup and Cann:</hi> while the ſpirit of the Wine is in him, and his heart is <hi>lifted up,</hi> he thinks there is none ſo merry as himſelf: But behold his heart that is thus <hi>lifted
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:118867:162"/>
up,</hi> is not <hi>right in him;</hi> or, as ſome expound it, it is not quiet in him; he hath no true peace, or ſolid joy, but even as it is with a drunken man, it may be the next morning, when the ſpirit of Wine is gone, his heart ſinks down, as <hi>Nabals</hi> did, as heavy and as dead as a ſtone; and therefore his heart that is thus lifted up with carnal joy, is not quiet, it is not right But the <hi>Juſt ſhall live by his faith;</hi> that is to ſay, He ſhall live <hi>comfortably,</hi> as the ſtrength of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition doth neceſſitate the ſenſe; he ſhall live comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in the midſt of troubles, as the other lives trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomely in the midſt of comforts. For as an unbeliever hath inward troubles, and unquietneſs of ſpirit in the midſt of all outward comforts; ſo a believer hath inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, in the midſt of all outward troubles. Be his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what it <hi>will</hi> be, or what it <hi>can</hi> be in other reſpects, yet the juſt ſhall rejoyce:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.9.</note>

The juſt live by Faith the Life of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation: God gives faithful men leave to be chearful; Pſal. 5.11. <hi>Let all thoſe that put their truſt in God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; yea, let them ſhout for joy.</hi> Nay, he <hi>commands</hi> them to be chearful, Luk. 8.48. <hi>And he ſaid unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</hi> Mark, he commands her to be of good comfort; and why? not ſo much becauſe ſhe was whole, as becauſe <hi>Faith</hi> had healed her; and ſo ſhe had inward peace, as well as outward healing. Thence it is, that Joy and Faith are uſually coupled together in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Phil. 1.25. <hi>[and joy of faith]</hi> It is called, <hi>The Joy of faith,</hi> as if all true Joy did come from Faith: 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>In whom believing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> Mark, when they were full of afflictions, and full of temptations, as appears by the connexion, yet they were full of glorious joy: And how came that to paſs, but by vertue of their Faith? In whom <hi>believing,</hi> ye <hi>rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c. That's the reaſon, why the Apoſtle would pray for the increaſe of the Peoples joy, when he prays for the increaſe of their Faith. Rom. 13.13. <hi>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> As if there were no joy without faith, and the more faith the more joy. No ſooner did the Eunuch believe, Act. 8 39. but the Text ſays, he <hi>went on his way rejoycing,</hi> as if he felt not the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:118867:163"/>
ground he went upon; his joy was a pleaſant companion by the way, who is as good as a Chariot. No ſooner did the trembling Jaylor believe, but it was ſaid, Act. 16.34. <hi>He ſet meat before the Apoſtles, and rejoyced, believing in God with all his houſhold.</hi> It was the merrieſt meals meat that he made in all his life. I do not ſay, that all believers have the ſame <hi>degree</hi> of joy, much leſs that they have the ſame <hi>joy</hi> at the <hi>firſt,</hi> 'tis enough that they have the ſeed of joy.

'Tis true indeed, the ſervice of Chriſt is called a <hi>burthen,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> and a <hi>yoke,</hi> and 'tis ſo for our corrupt nature; but ſo far as we are ſpiritual, although the yoke is rough (you ſee nothing at the firſt, but Afflictions, and Perſecutions, and Self-denial) yet the inſide is ſmooth,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:118867:163"/>
and eaſie, 'tis tied on with the ſilken ſtring of Love, and ſtuft with nothing but Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. It's better to <hi>feel;</hi> than to <hi>ſee:</hi> for many have boggled at the yoke, that have but look'd upon it afar off; but never any that took it up and wore it, but highly commended it to be the ſweeteſt and eaſieſt yoke in the world, they have found ſuch comfort in it. And this, I ſay, makes much for the honour of the Maſter.</p>

It is not all one in point of comfort, whether we ſin or ſin not. God is a wiſe, as well as a loving Father; he will ſhew no countenance to his own children, if they <hi>regard iniquity in their heart,</hi> Pſal. 66 18. If I regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, God will not hear my Prayer: <hi>But bleſſed are the pure in heart;</hi> Why? <hi>they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. What of that? why, here's the comfort, here's the happineſs, here's the very heaven of a Chriſtian, <hi>to ſee God,</hi> 1 Joh 3 2. For, Viſion of God, works Transforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Image of God, Satisfaction; and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even abundance of Soul-raviſhing Conſolation.

the <hi>approbation</hi> and allowance of any ſin, from the regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any iniquity in their heart. If a juſtified perſon do not act his Faith to the purifying of his heart and life, (In that ſenſe we ſpeak of) God will certainly ſuſpend his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for a time: The Sun of Righteouſneſs will not ſhine upon a <hi>Dunghil</hi> heart but upon the <hi>Garden;</hi> for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is <hi>grieved</hi> by the ſins of his own people, or elſe that Exhortation were needleſs, Eph. 4.30. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi> And if we grieve the Spirit of God, be ſure it will grieve our ſpirits; it will make us glad to cry, <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation,</hi> Pſal 51.12. And if we rejoyce the Spirit of Ged, it will rejoyce <hi>ours,</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me,</hi> ſaith Wiſdom; ſo, I rejoyce them that rejoyce me: and what rejoyces Gods Spirit, but purity of heart and life? Prov. 11.20. <hi>The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the way are his delight.</hi> So God diſpenſes peace to ſuch, Pſal. 85.8. <hi>It is God who will speak peace to his Saints,</hi> to his ſanctified ones. 'Tis true indeed, a man cannot be ſanctified before he be juſtified; and ſo ſoon as he is juſtified, he hath the ground-work of peace. But the Word doth ſtrongly infer, That no man is juſtified, but he is alſo ſanctified at the ſame time: And God is pleaſed to ſpeak peace to none, but ſuch as he is pleaſed to ſanctifie at the ſame inſtant, when he firſt begins to ſpeak peace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.

come with a Rod in his hand, if they once wax wanton un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the expreſſion of his love and favour. Rev. 3.19. <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten; be zealous therefore, and repent.</hi> Well then, as ever thou deſireſt to live the Life of Conſolation, be ſure to live the Life of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Though God do not diſpenſe comfort <hi>for</hi> thy Sanctification, yet he will never diſpenſe it <hi>without</hi> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.

                     <p>It is true, the firſt evidence of a Chriſtians Juſtification in order of nature, is a pure ſimple act of Faith, laying hold on Gods free grace in a Promiſe indefinite, made not to righteous perſons, but to ſinners, ungodlly perſons, and to enemies, and to ſuch as are ſimply ſo: For God will ſtrip a man of all conceits of his own Righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he clothe him with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>But then the ſecond evidence of Juſtification in order of nature, (though it be at the ſame inſtant in order of time, if we could perceive it) is a heart renewed and ſanctified, and in ſome meaſure indowed with a love of that God, who hath <hi>begotten us to a lively hope,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.3.</note> and with a love of our fellow-brethren, who are begotten of the ſame <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed,</hi> and born of the ſame womb;<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 5 2.</note> who hang upon the ſame Breſts, and are heirs of the ſame inheritance with our ſelves. Now when we ſee theſe things in our ſelves by a reflect act of Faith, the teſtimony of a renewed Conſcience; this evidence muſt needs bring abundance of comfort to the Soul. This reflect act of Faith, it is like the Rainbow, which is nothing elſe but the reflection of the Sun in a watry Cloud; which though it be no <hi>Cauſe</hi> why the earth ſhall no more be drowned with waters, yet it is made a ſure <hi>Sign</hi> thereof by the Ordinance of God, Gen. 2.10, 11, 12. So we ſay of this reflect act of Faith, in the looking upon the work of Love, and other ſanctified Graces in the Soul; though they are no cauſes why the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:118867:172"/>
believing Soul ſhall be no more overflowed with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Gods wrath, yet they are a ſure ſign and token thereof by Gods appointment, as the Rainbow was. And indeed, the way of grace in Gods ſanctified ones, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the reflection of the Sun of Righteouſneſs in a watry cloudy Soul, warming and melting it into tears, becauſe it can love Jeſus Chriſt no more, or can get no more aſſurance of his love.

In the fear of God.</note>As for the firſt, An unregenerate man may have ſuch a fear of God, as to endevour to depart from <hi>ſome</hi> evil, but not from <hi>all;</hi> like the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, after the Lord ſent Lions amongſt them, <hi>They feared the Lord, and yet feared their own gods</hi> too; and therefore the Lord accounted it as <hi>no fear</hi> at all, 2 King. 17.33, 34.

But the oyl of grace is truly lovely to a gracious heart: They have ſpiritual ſenſe, to ſmell the ſweet favour of the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Cant. 1.2 and they love the light, Joh 3.21.

                     <p>Secondly, Not <hi>all their graces.</hi> They may admire their <hi>common gifts,</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> admired the wiſdom of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the wiſdom of <hi>Daniel,</hi> but not their <hi>ſaving graces: Every one that doth evil, hateth the light,</hi> Joh. 3.20. Even that light of good works.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Not <hi>at all times.</hi> God ſometimes indeed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules their ſpirits ſtrongly, as he over-ruled the ſpirits of Lions, to preſerve <hi>Daniel;</hi> and of the Ravens, to feed <hi>Elijah:</hi> but ſo ſoon as that over-ruling Providence is over, they are as they were before God, for a time, gave the Iſraelites favour in the eyes of the Egyptians; but before and after, they were their utter enemies: but he that hath truth of grace, he loves;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. All the Saints, poor as well as rich: Phil. 1.15. and <hi>love unto all the Saints.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. At all times, becauſe his love ſprings from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle, from likeneſs of nature, and therefore it is unchangeable. Now this upon trial is ground of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comfort; and this trial is made by Faith.

Faith being ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a hand to keep off ſuch things as are any ways <hi>uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,</hi> and to draw in alſo, all ſuch things as are truly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable</hi> to the Soul. <hi>David</hi> was a religious man, and yet a comfortable man; yes, <hi>therefore</hi> cheerful, <hi>becauſe</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. <hi>The ſweet ſinger was uſually as comfortable as a Bird in May. Belſhazzar</hi> was extremely ſad in the midſt of his Cups; and <hi>therefore</hi> ſad, <hi>becauſe</hi> wicked: he looked as pale, when he ſaw the hand-writing upon the wall, as if there had been <hi>death</hi> in the laſt Cup he drank. It is true, wicked men may be <hi>outwardly</hi> merry, as Gods People may be ſometimes ſad: but look, as in a wicked mans joy there is always the <hi>ſeed</hi> of ſorrow; ſo in a godly mans <hi>ſorrow,</hi> there is always the <hi>ſeed</hi> of joy. Therefore ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, Luk. 6.21. <hi>Bleſſed are ye that weep now, for ye ſhall laugh:</hi> but he threatens the contrary to ſuch as be of a <hi>contrary</hi> ſpirit, ver. 25. <hi>Woe unto you that laugh now, for ye ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> He is a wiſe man, that will ſorrow for a <hi>moment,</hi> that he may rejoyce for <hi>ever:</hi> But he is a mad man, that will purchaſe his joy at ſo dear a rate, as to rejoyce for a moment, although he pay for it in ſorrow to all eternity. It is the wiſe mans judgement of the <hi>fools</hi> mirth, Eccleſ. 2.2. <hi>I ſaid of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, It is madneſs, and of mirth, What doſt thou?</hi> A wiſe man may give his judgement of a fools joy; but a fool is no competent judge of a wiſe mans joy. Prov. 14.10. <hi>A ſtranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.</hi> And therefore when a wicked man ſpeaks evil of the ways of God, he ſpeaks evil of the things he <hi>knows not.</hi> For the juſt lives by Faith the Life of Conſolation.</p>

But Spiritual joy is ſafe and wholeſome, wholeſome for the Soul: It's a good means to concoct our knowledge, To love the Truth, and rejoyce in what we know; while otherwiſe, the ſweeteſt Truths will lie raw and indigeſted upon the ſtomach of the Soul.

that I have lived once again to ſee thee, and am ſo near to enjoy my ſureſt friends within thee.] Juſt thus is it with a man that is bound for heaven, that lives by Faith in regard of Life Eternal: When he well remembers his great diſtance <hi>from God, and Chriſt, the Saints departed, (for whilſt we are here at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord)</hi> I ſay, when he remembers this, it fetcheth many a ſigh, and tear, and groan from his heart. Pſal. 137.1. <hi>By the waters of Babylon we ſate down, and wept when we remembred thee O Sion.</hi> See how they hang their heads, and they hang their harps by the water-ſide, as if they neither took delight in themſelves, nor any thing elſe, whilſt they are ſo far from their Native Country: So 'tis with a creature that is <hi>Heaven-born,</hi> and <hi>Heaven-bound,</hi> he cries and ſighs, and groans while he is ſo far from home. 2 Cor. 5.4. <hi>For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burthened, &amp;c.</hi> And how glad are ſuch, when they come near their journeys end?

Our Speeches.</note> by our <hi>outward ſpeeches,</hi> (For Meditation, is the <hi>ſpeech of the heart by it ſelf</hi>) by our ſpeeches to others. Where there is much of heaven in the heart, there will be ſomething of heaven in the tongue. Several Countrymen, have a ſeveral dialect or language, and you may know what Country a man belongs to, by his <hi>ſpeech.</hi> As the damoſel ſaid to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Even thy speech bewrayeth thee:</hi> So a mans ſpeech will bewray him, and ſhew whether he belongs to heaven or earth: <hi>He that is of the earth ſpeaketh of the earth, and he that is of heaven ſpeaketh of heaven,</hi> Joh. 3.31. When God would ſhew the ſound converſion of the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians to the Faith, he ſaith, <hi>Five cities in the land of Egypt ſhall ſpeak the language of Canaan,</hi> Iſa. 19.18. that is, They ſhall have heavenly hearts, for they ſhall have heavenly tongues. 'Tis true, a man may learn and counterfeit the language of another country where he hath never dwelt, and hath nothing to do in the priviledges of it, (and there are too many ſuch <hi>Beggarly, Canting</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.) And therefore we are to examine not onely what we ſpeak, but from what <hi>Fountain</hi> and principle we ſpeak: Pſa. 45.1. <hi>My heart is inditing a good matter;</hi> and then, <hi>My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</hi> Pro. 16.23. <hi>The heart of the wiſe teacheth his mouth.</hi> So then, if we do but obſerve our ſelves, when we ſpeak <hi>out of the abundance of our hearts,</hi> our ſpeech will certainly bewray what country we belong to. Never ſay therefore, that thou liveſt by Faith in reſpect of heaven, ſo long as thy ſpeeches are <hi>earthly, ſenſual, or devilliſh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He that believes he hath a great inheritance in another country, he loves to be talking of it; and ſo does a Citizen of Heaven. 2 Cor. 4.15. <hi>We having the ſame Spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I ſpoken; we alſo believe, and therefore do we ſpeak.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>And however ſome may indevour to counterfeit the <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Canaan,</hi> yet there will be one <hi>Shibboleth</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that will diſcover them. At the beſt, they are but like <hi>mongrel Jews,</hi> born of <hi>outlandiſh women,</hi> who had Jews for their Fathers, and Aſhdodites for their Mothers, and therefore they ſpeak a <hi>mongrel Language, half in the language of Canaan, and half in the language of Aſhdod,</hi> Neh. 13.23, 24. And ſo do theſe, one while their mouth is full of Bleſſing, and holy ſpeeches; another while they are full of Curſing, and Blaſphemy, and Ribaldry, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their company ſuits their humour.</p>

And this is that, which diſcovers a Citizen of Heaven, when ſuch a ſpeech doth naturally flow from the heart, (I mean, from a principle of renewed nature) and ſo it's true, which Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned,</hi> Mat. 12.37.</p>

                        <p>But if thou canſt live in known and groſs ſins, under the Power and Dominion of them (I know the beſt have their failings, which they groan under as their burthen:) but, if thou canſt <hi>wittingly, willingly and conſtantly</hi> live under the Power of any reigning luſt, and yet for all <hi>that,</hi> thou ſayeſt, Thou liveſt by Faith in reſpect of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life; I ſay, Thy Faith is but a <hi>Fancy;</hi> it's a <hi>ſtrong Preſumption,</hi> and therefore a <hi>strong Deluſion.</hi> Thou art groſly deceived, if thou thinkeſt to get Heaven, or to inherit the Kingdom of God in ſuch a way.</p>

                        <p>But if a man thinks himſelf already in Chriſt, and in the high-way to Heaven, and yet remains under the power and Dominion of theſe reigning luſts, he is groſly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

                           <note place="margin">1. In his own death.</note>1. The firſt was performed by Chriſt <hi>(proprio Marte)</hi> in his own ſingle combat with Death and Hell. Chriſt taking upon him the ſins of Gods people all the world over, Death ſets upon him moſt furiouſly, and ſeems at the firſt Bout, to get the better; it kills him, and lays him in the grave. But behold the glorious Victory of Jeſus Chriſt; as <hi>Samſon,</hi> when he was ſhut up in the City of <hi>Gaza,</hi> Judg. 16. <hi>He aroſe in the night, anâ car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the gates of the City, and bars and all:</hi> So Chriſt, our <hi>Spiritual Samſon,</hi> was ſhut up in the <hi>Grave</hi> with a <hi>great ſtone</hi> upon the Grave, and brake open the <hi>brazen gates,</hi> and <hi>iron bars,</hi> and hath carried them away to the <hi>top of the Mountain</hi> (of <hi>Mount Sion</hi>) that they ſhall never hurt his people more.</p>
                        <p>Acts 2.24. <hi>He was raiſed up by the power of his God-head, having looſed the pains of Death, becauſe it was not poſſible he ſhould be holden of it. [Looſed the pains of Death]</hi> It's a word uſed in the birth of Children, as if the <hi>Grave were pained</hi> (as a woman in child-birth) till it was delivered of him who was the <hi>firſt-begotton from the dead,</hi> and ſo had the prerogative of the <hi>firſt-born,</hi> to be a Conqueror, even a Conqueror over Death. Therefore it is ſaid, Rev. 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the Keys of Hell and Death. [The Keys]</hi> What's that? By the <hi>Keys,</hi> is certainly meant <hi>the Conqueſt;</hi> as when a Town or City is ſubdued, the <hi>Keys</hi> are preſently deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Conqueror, as acknowledgments, and <hi>Enſigns</hi> of his Victory. So, the Keys of Hell and Death are
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:118867:205"/>
delivered up into the hands of Chriſt, to ſignifie, that Chriſt <hi>being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, Death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> but he for ever hath domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over Death.</p>
                        <p>So that the firſt and chief part of the victory belongs to Chriſt in his own perſon, as he was <hi>mightily declared to be the Son of God, by his Reſurrection from the Grave:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> the other three belong to us.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Degree of Victory over Death, is,<note place="margin">2. In our Death.</note> 
                           <hi>The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering its nature to all Gods people.</hi> For no ſooner had Death ſtruck Chriſt (like a furious Waſp) but it preſently loſt its Sting: For, the <hi>ſting of Death</hi> ſticks in Sin, and therefore Chriſt having taken upon him the ſins of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Death</hi> ſtrikes in her ſting ſo deep, that ſhe is forced to leave it behinde her: So that now the caſe is altered to Gods people, however <hi>they</hi> die as well as others, yet to them, the ſting of Death is taken out, and ſo the nature of Death is quite and clean altered, as if it were not the ſame. Before it was a paſſage <hi>into priſon, [where the Spirits are now in priſon]</hi> Now it's made a paſſage <hi>out</hi> of Priſon, [<hi>Having a deſire to be diſſolved,</hi> Phil 1.23.] Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a curſe; now a Bleſſing, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, which die in the Lord,</hi> Rev. 14.13. Before it was an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (a wicked man might ſay, Haſt thou found me,<note place="margin">1 Kings 21.20</note> O mine enemy!) but now it's a Friend, and does many friendly offices. Before it was <hi>loſs;</hi> a man loſt his friends, he loſt his poſſeſſions, he loſt his very hopes, Eccleſ. 9.4. but now it's <hi>gain,</hi> Phil. 1.21. <hi>To die is gain:</hi> He gains much acceſs of glory for the preſent in his Soul, in regard of its communion with God; and he hath hopes of more, when his body ſhall be raiſed again from the grave. Prov. 14.22. <hi>The wicked is driven away in his wickedneſs, but the righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> And this is the ſecond part of Chriſts Victory over Death.</p>

And this is the fourth and laſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Chriſts Victory and Triumph over Death: after which, there ſhall be <hi>no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, nor pain,</hi> Rev. 21.4.</p>
                        <p>Well then, to bring all home to the preſent Uſe.</p>
                        <p>Wouldſt thou know whether thou liveſt by Faith in regard of Life Eternal? Do but tell me in earneſt, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tell thine own Soul, what reſpect thou beareſt to Death. Doſt thou indeed look at it as a conquered Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my? or rather ſuch an one, as of an enemy is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a friend.</p>
                        <p>Is thy judgement altered concerning Death, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Death it ſelf is altered? Then well and good: For thus 'tis with all Gods people in ſome meaſure, Death and they are made friends, they look at Death as a ſweet <hi>paſſage</hi> to this Everlaſting Life that we are ſpeaking of; and therefore they bid it welcome. What Heir would not be willing to come to his Inheritance, and therefore as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to welcome the Meſſenger, that had Power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to put him into preſent poſſeſſion? This was the Apoſtles practice; His whole life was a Meditation of Death, and a Preparation for Death: <hi>I profeſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>by our rejoycing which I have in Chriſt Jeſus, I die daily;</hi> that is, I am every day prepared for death, 1 Cor. 15.31.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:118867:207"/>
Therefore you may ſee his judgement was altered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of death; he looked at it as an enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſion, but now he looks at it as a friend. He that is reconciled to God, and God to him, he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to death, and death alſo to him: for, death is but the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt; and if Chriſt be yours, death is yours alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21, 22.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obj.</hi> But may not Gods own people be afraid of death, and <hi>unfit</hi> to die?</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">About the fear of Death.</note>
                           <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. They may be afraid, becauſe every Chriſtian man is <hi>a double man,</hi> conſiſting of Fleſh and Spirit; and therefore, though the Spirit is <hi>willing,</hi> yet the <hi>Fleſh is weak,</hi> Mat. 21.46. Therefore ſo far as he is natural, he is afraid; and yet ſo far as he is ſpiritual, he overcomes that fear: So that here is the difference between the fear of a wicked man, and a godly man: A wicked man (when God opens his eyes) is <hi>ſwallowed up</hi> of fear; a godly man, though he may have many conflicts and combats with the fear of death, yet at laſt he overcomes his <hi>fear,</hi> by the exerciſe of his <hi>Faith;</hi> ſo that he is not in bondage to his fear, as the other is. Heb 2.15. <hi>Chriſt came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, who through fear of death were all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſubject to bondage.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. A godly man is not at all times alike fit to die (though he be willing in the main.) It may be, he hath ſome work to do for God, or for his Church, that yet is not done: It may be, he hath weakned himſelf by ſome preſent diſtemper, and hath not ſtrength of Faith ſufficient for ſuch a ſolemn and ſerious Work, as is his paſſage to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And that was the cauſe of <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer, Pſal. 39. laſt, <hi>O ſpare a little, that I may recover ſtrength, before I go hence, and be no more.</hi> In ſuch like caſes as theſe, a godly man may be ſomewhat <hi>unfit,</hi> and therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>unwilling</hi> to die; otherwiſe, I ſay, in the main, he looks at death as his friend, becauſe God in Chriſt is his friend; and therefore the more he <hi>loves</hi> God, the leſs he <hi>fears</hi> death.</p>
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:118867:207"/>
                        <p>If love were <hi>perfect,</hi> it would caſt out <hi>all fear.</hi> In the mean time, as the love of God increaſeth, the fear of death decreaſeth from day to day. And that is a good evidence the creature lives by Faith in regard of Life Eternal.</p>
                        <p>But now, if we look at Death as the greateſt of Evils, of all terrible things, the moſt terrible, as if it were the <hi>Annihilation</hi> of the Creature, or the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it into a far <hi>worſe</hi> condition than it was in before. So that, when a <hi>Man</hi> dies, his <hi>Hope dies</hi> with him too, Job 11. verſ. the laſt. It is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That ſuch a man lives not by Faith in regard of Life Eternal: for, if he did, he would ſurely welcome <hi>that Death,</hi> which is no other than a paſſage to <hi>that Life.</hi>

However, we are not tied to the obſervation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath, yet <hi>there remains a reſt to the people of God,</hi> Heb. 4 9. As the <hi>full</hi> reſt and Sabbatiſm does <hi>remain</hi> and will remain, not to be fully poſſeſt by them, till the general Reſurrection; ſo <hi>that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſory Reſt and Sabbath</hi> which is ordained to be a ſign and a pledge of the other, muſt needs remain, till we come to enjoy <hi>that,</hi> whereof this is a <hi>pledge.</hi> If <hi>this</hi> Sabbath be a <hi>ſign</hi> and pledge of heaven, and of <hi>Gods perfect ſanctifying</hi> of his people in Souls and Bodies (Exod. 31.13.) then it muſt be kept till we come <hi>there:</hi> for if we loſe the <hi>pledge</hi> of a Benefit, we loſe the <hi>evidence</hi> of that Benefit, whereof it is a Pledge.</p>
                        <p>Conſider further, the Sabbath was not onely ordained to be a <hi>pledge</hi> of Eternal Reſt, to aſſure us of it, but to be a <hi>Means</hi> alſo to fit us for it. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man,</hi> for mans benefit; and <hi>that,</hi> not onely for his bodily reſt, but eſpecially for the reſt of his Soul, that he might ceaſe from the works of ſin, and learn to do the work of God. And experience ſhews, the <hi>right</hi> ſanctifying of the Sabbath, is a powerful means under Chriſt, to ſanctifie <hi>us,</hi> to increaſe Faith, Love, Zeal, and all ſaving graces. It takes a man off from the world (for ſuch a man thinks not his own thoughts, ſpeaks not his own words, does not

                        <p n="1">1. of all, the happineſs of heaven is moſt <hi>pure,</hi> Rev. 22 1.

                        <p n="2">2. It is moſt <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>ſecure,</hi> becauſe out of the reach of Satan and all enemies.

                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe, is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Son: 1 Joh. 5.11. <hi>And this is the Witneſs, that God hath given us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> Cauſe <hi>offering</hi> and holding forth Eternal Life is the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 1.16, 17.

                           <note place="margin">5. By Effects.</note>Fifthly, the excellency of Life Eternal, appears as from the Cauſes, ſo from the <hi>Effects</hi> alſo, which are admirable and glorious; <hi>viz.</hi> Man's being made <hi>like to the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> Matth. 22.30. yea, as like to Chriſt himſelf as may be.

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:118867:216"/>
the former, ſhall be made conformable to Chriſt in the latter. Phil. 3. laſt, <hi>He ſhall change our vile bodie, that it might be made like his glorious bodie, &amp;c.</hi> And as in Body, ſo in Soul alſo; in the <hi>whole</hi> man. Was Chriſt a King, Prieſt, and Prophet? ſo are they that are Chriſts. Revel. 1.6. <hi>He hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and his Father:</hi> What follows? <hi>Therefore to him be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> If all Gods Saints have ſuch honour, how ſhould they honour <hi>Him</hi> who <hi>thus</hi> honours them of his <hi>free grace,</hi> and will honour them to all <hi>Eternity?</hi> If Eternal Life be ſo excellent a gift, as appears by the Epithetes that are given to it, by the excellent Properties of it, by the excellent Price given for it, by the excellent Cauſes of it, and by the excellent Effects of it: Then ſurely, as we have cauſe to admire the unparallell'd expreſſions of Gods goodneſs to us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; So have we cauſe to break forth into thankfulneſs, as oft as we <hi>think</hi> of it, and act our Faith for it. No <hi>ſooner</hi> did the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> think of that heavenly Inheritance, but he muſt needs break forth into bleſſing of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can tell how to ſpeak of it, or to utter what he had conceived about it: 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, &amp;c.</hi> Mark, he cannot think of the inheritance, but he is forced to break forth into bleſſing. What though we have not reaped our full har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt? yet you know Gods People were commanded to bring their Oblation of Thankſgiving, when they received their <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> becauſe the firſt-fruits were a Pawn and Pledge of the <hi>whole</hi> Harveſt, Deut. 26. So we are bound to be thankful to God, when we have but received the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> of grace, (when we have but ſo much grace, as to live by <hi>Faith</hi> for Life Eternal) becauſe the firſt-fruits of grace do aſcertain us of a <hi>full</hi> Harveſt of glory in due
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:118867:217"/>
time. What though we have not yet a perfect victory over all our enemies, Sin, Satan, and Death? yet as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> when God had delivered him and his People from the danger of the Sea, and <hi>Pharoabs</hi> hoſt, he ſings a Song of Thankſgiving to the Lord (Exod. 15.1.) though the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils of the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> and other evils were <hi>ſtill behinde;</hi> yet, I ſay, he is thankful, becauſe theſe firſt victories were <hi>a</hi> Pawn and a Pledge to them of a full and plenary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and that God would never leave them, till he had planted them in <hi>Canaan it ſelf:</hi> yea, in that Celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> where God reigns for ever and ever. And this was the ground of <hi>Moſes</hi> his thankfulneſs, ver. 14. <hi>The People ſhall hear, and be afraid, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Fear and dread ſhall fall upon them by the greatneſs of thine Arm, they ſhall be as ſtill as a ſtone, till thy people paſs over, (O Lord) till thy people paſs over which thou haſt purchaſed: Thou ſhalt bring them in, and plant them in the Mountain of thine Inheritance; in the place, O Lord, which thou haſt made for thee to dwell in; in the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, O Lord, which thy hands have eſtabliſhed. The Lord ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi> Thus Gods People (like <hi>Moſes</hi>) are thankful for Victories, not onely preſent and paſt, but <hi>future</hi> alſo. Though Gods People are <hi>yet upon the Sea</hi> of this world, and not paſt the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> they have, cauſe to be thankful, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, becauſe they have both a <hi>Promiſe and a Pledge of Canaan,</hi> as he had. Therefore it is obſervable, that Gods people under the New Teſtament, ſtanding upon the <hi>glaſſie Sea</hi> of this world, are ſaid to ſing the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb, Rev. 15.2, 3. <hi>And I ſaw as it were a Sea of glaſs, &amp;c. They ſing the Song of Moſes the Servant of God, and the Song of the Lamb,</hi> that is. They ſing ſuch a Song as <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſing, both for Mercies <hi>paſt,</hi> and alſo in <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hope</hi> of Mercies to <hi>come.</hi> And this Song is taught by the Lamb, (that is, by the Lamb of God) to all ſuch as are <hi>redeemed</hi> by him, and none can ſing this Song, but ſuch
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:118867:217"/>
as are redeemed. A man cannot be thankful for that which he hath nothing to ſhew for: he that hath nothing to ſhew for Heaven, how is it poſſible ſuch a man ſhould be thankful for it? And therefore ſuch as have the <hi>White Stone,</hi> and the <hi>New Name,</hi> and the Name of Chriſt and <hi>his Father</hi> written in their <hi>Foreheads,</hi> are ſuch as ſing this Song of Thankfulneſs: Rev. 14.1, 3. <hi>And they ſing (as it were) a new Song before the Throne, and before the four Beaſts, and the Elders, and no man could learn that Song, but the hundred fourty four thouſand, which were redeemed from the earth.</hi> None but holy Men, and holy Angels, are fit for this work; none can give hearty praiſe to God for victory over Sin, Satan, and Antichriſt, or for the Comforts of another World, but they that have a part and a lot in that Inheritance. As a ſtranger inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddles not with the joy of Gods people: ſo neither with that Praiſe which is onely comely in their mouthes, Therefore let the redeemed of the Lord praiſe him, and be thankful to him.</p>

It is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Argument, 1 Cor. 15. laſt, (having diſcours'd at large of the glorious condition of Gods People after the Reſurrection) <hi>Therefore my beloved Brethren, be ye ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as you know, that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> O that we would oft conſider, there is an Eternity for Reward, but a ſhort time for work! and when the time of this Life is once paſt, there is not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond opportunity, there is no returning back again, there is no doing of any thing in the <hi>Grave:</hi> Therefore let us work,<note place="margin">Joh. 9.4.</note> while we have the light of Life; <hi>the night</hi> of death <hi>comes, wherein no man can work;</hi> no man can then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or repent, or bring forth the fruits of repentance: There is no repentance in <hi>Hell to any purpoſe;</hi> and if we
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:118867:219"/>
repent of any thing in heaven, it ſhall be of this, that we did God no more and no better ſervice upon earth. And therefore ſo oft as we caſt an eye upon the <hi>Eternity</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the <hi>ſhort</hi> time of our work, let us beſtir our ſelves in our places. Take the counſel of the Wiſe man, Eccleſ 9.10. <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findeth to do,</hi> (either for God, or for the Church of God, or for thy own Soul) <hi>do it with all thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor Wiſdom in the grave, whither thou art going:</hi> He that thinks ſeriouſly of his Eternal condition after death, cannot be an unprofitable Servant in his life.</p>

                  <hi>QUEST. VIII.</hi> What are the Reaſons for living by Faith?</head>
               <p>WE come now to the Eighth Particular, the <hi>Reaſons why God will have the Juſt to live by Faith.</hi> We have given particular Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the particular <hi>Branches</hi> before, (as, Why the Juſt lives by Faith the Life of <hi>Juſtification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Renovation, Fructification, Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Vivification,</hi> &amp;c.) We ſhall now give the <hi>general</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which reach to all in general; <hi>Why</hi> God will have the Juſt to live <hi>by Faith.</hi> It is true, God is not bound to give us a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or give us an account of any of his Matters, Job 33.13. It is the folly of <hi>vain man,</hi> to call Gods Wiſdom to the <hi>Bar</hi> of his ſhallow <hi>Reaſon</hi> But Rom. 9.20. <hi>Who art, &amp;c.</hi> Gods Will may well ſtand for a Reaſon. And yet, God is pleaſed in this particular, to give us a <hi>Reaſon</hi> of his Will. Wicked men, in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:118867:220"/>
are ſaid to be <hi>unreaſonable men,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.2. they do a thing, becauſe they will do it, though they have no <hi>good</hi> Reaſon for it. But God, though he is <hi>moſt Abſolute and Independent,</hi> is pleaſed in this matter of <hi>Faith</hi> to give us a <hi>Reaſon</hi> of his Will, That man might not diſpute and wrangle with God, and ſay, What <hi>Reaſon</hi> have I to live by Faith, ſeeing I have little or nothing in hand. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God tells us, There is <hi>all the Reaſon in the world,</hi> a man ſhould live by Faith. Therefore unreaſonable men are ſaid to be ſuch as have <hi>no faith,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.2. becauſe there is great reaſon a Chriſtian man ſhould live by Faith. So, though Faith be above Reaſon in ſome ſenſe, to wit, above carnal, corrupt Reaſon: yet it is not above in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned and rectified Reaſon.</p>
               <p>There is manifold reaſon,<note place="margin">Reaſons for living by faith</note> why a Chriſtian ſhould be willing to live by Faith. All may be reduced to three Heads.</p>

                  <item>1. From a Believers <hi>Condition</hi> in the Fleſh.</item>

               <p>Firſt, From a Believers <hi>Condition</hi> in the Fleſh.<note place="margin">From our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the fleſh.</note> For diſtance of place between the perſon that makes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the perſon <hi>to whom</hi> it is made, requires the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Faith to aſſure of the Performance.</p>
               <p>Now firſt, The Believer is <hi>abſent from the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Abſence from the Lord.</note> and from the <hi>Preſence</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. Though he do enjoy in ſome meaſure the preſence of his Grace, yet ſo long as he lives here below, he cannot enjoy the preſence of his Glory. He that is far diſtant from him that makes a Promiſe, had need have ſome good Evidence and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his faithfulneſs and ability. 2 Cor. 5.6. <hi>Whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> from our laſt home. What of that? (therefore ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:118867:221"/>
in the next words) <hi>we walk by faith, and not by ſight.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, He that hath not the Evidence of <hi>Senſe,</hi> had need have the Evidence of <hi>Faith</hi> from a ſure Word of God. But Gods People in this life have not the Evidence of <hi>Senſe</hi> or Sight in their higheſt degree; therefore they had need have the Evidence of <hi>Faith</hi> for their <hi>Security.</hi> Their life is a Life of Faith: for, <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. And that is the firſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Diſtance of time.</note>The ſecond Reaſon, is drawn from the great <hi>diſtance of time</hi> betwixt Gods <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Performance</hi> of the thing promiſed. Sometimes ſome ſcores, ſome hundreds, ſome thouſands of years; therefore Gods People ſtand in need of ſome Security in the mean time, to aſſure them that God will make good his Word at the laſt. Now this ſecurity is Faith; and therefore obſerve the connexion of the Text, to the former verſe, <hi>The juſt lives by his faith:</hi> Why ſo? becauſe, ſaith the third verſe, <hi>the Viſion is for an appointed time.</hi> Gods Promiſe (manifeſted by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Prophet) ſhall not preſently be fulfilled, but in its appointed time. Therefore, in the mean time, the juſt man lives by his Faith, he takes Gods bare Word for it, he believes it ſhall be ſo: The Spirit of God working by the Promiſe, aſſures him it ſhall be ſo; and this puts life into the Promiſe, and life into him that apprehends the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Faith is a Chriſtians Security, till God pay in that which he is <hi>bound for</hi> in the Covenant of Free Grace. It is juſt like the Witneſs and Seal to the Bond; as, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, ſets to his Seal that God is true,</hi> Joh. 3.30. So God himſelf, by giving Faith, ſets to his Seal and Witneſs, that he means truly and faithfully to perform his Promiſe: 1 Joh. 5.10. <hi>He that believeth, hath the witneſs in himſelf.</hi> Now I ſay, This Witneſs and Seal is very needful for the ſupport of poor weak creatures, becauſe there is ſo great a time betwixt the Promiſe and the Performance. It is
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:118867:221"/>
nothing ſo much to rejoyce in the things promiſed, when we ſee them fulfilled by the eye of Senſe.<note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> As old <hi>Simeon</hi> falls a ſinging, when he ſaw Chriſt with his bodily eyes, and embraced him in his very Arms, he might well ſay, with S. <hi>John, That which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the Word of life, even that declare we unto you:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not but rejoyce. But it was much more in old Father <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> when he did ſo much rejoyce to ſee Chriſt and his day, ſo many thouſand years before he came into the world; when he could ſee him no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but by the eye of <hi>Faith,</hi> and yet he rejoyced, as if he had been in <hi>Simeons</hi> condition: as if Chriſt had been preſent with him at that very time, becauſe Faith aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him it ſhould be ſo. And in this reſpect all Believers ſtand in need of Faith, becauſe uſually there is ſome <hi>good diſtance</hi> of time betwixt the Promiſe and the Performance, and Faith is their Security in the mean time. And that's the ſecond Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon is this,<note place="margin">3. Need of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> To keep us in a continual frame of <hi>Humility.</hi> God will have us to live by Faith as long as we live in this life. For the truth is, The beſt of Gods Servants (in regard of remaining corruption) when they poſſeſs much in hand, they are apt to to be <hi>puft up</hi> with pride and ſelf-confidence, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was.<note place="margin">Iſa. 39.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>that</hi> end, that <hi>no fleſh might glory in his preſence,</hi> look as God chooſeth the weak, and baſe, and deſpiſed things of the world, in their <hi>firſt</hi> converſion; ſo he keeps them in ſuch a manner of condition all their life long, that by Faith they might be fain to go to him for every thing they want in Temporals and in Spirituals. In <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals</hi> they muſt live like <hi>Beggars,</hi> they muſt beg of him their <hi>daily Bread;</hi> and ſo in <hi>Spirituals</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> they muſt go to God for new ſupplies of <hi>Grace,</hi> and for <hi>new ſtrength,</hi> upon the performance of every <hi>new duty.</hi> The moſt eminent Chriſtian hath not grace beforehand in the ſtock
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:118867:222"/>
for one year, or day, or hour; not enough to perform the next Duty, or to reſiſt the next Tentation from Satan or the World. 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but all our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of God:</hi> Phil 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me:</hi> But will Chriſt ſtrengthen thoſe to do any great matter, whom he doth not ſtrengthen to believe? No ſurely, <hi>According to thy faith be it unto thee,</hi> Mat. 8.13. &amp; 9.29. Therefore a Chriſtian lives by Faith every day, and in every duty. He fetches ſtrength from Chriſt, as well as ſight. (Iſa. 45.24. <hi>Surely, &amp;c.) Sight,</hi> for the acceptance of my perſon; <hi>Strength,</hi> for the performance of my duty. God feeds them, and ſupplies them but onely from hand to mouth, leſt they ſhould be <hi>exalted above meaſure.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> And the hand that receives (to wit, the hand of Faith) is an empty hand too: It brings nothing to God, but it receives all from God; but yet it receives not preſently, but tarries his leiſure. Nay, God gives not onely the <hi>Gift</hi> it ſelf, but the very hand that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the gift, leſt any man <hi>ſhould boaſt.</hi> For, <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8. And all this, to keep us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is the Chriſtians Caterer, or Purveyor, or Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. It is like a little poor Boy, that is ſent out of doors, and ſo goes up and down to beg a living for his old decrepit father, who lies bedrid at home: I ſay, We, like poor creatures, can earn nothing of our ſelves by the merit of our own works, towards our living. Now Faith, like the little Boy, it goes a begging to God for a living: For Faith ſets <hi>Prayer</hi> a work, and Prayer ſets <hi>God</hi> himſelf a work for our good: And ſo the Juſt lives by his Faith. Now he that lives upon <hi>Alms,</hi> upon his meer dependance upon anothers good will, he hath great cauſe to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. There is nothing more odious and abſurd, than a proud Beggar: But he that lives by Faith, lives meerly upon the good-will and free grace of God in Chriſt;
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:118867:222"/>
and therefore hath great cauſe to be humble. And that is the third Reaſon under the firſt general Head, drawn from a Believers <hi>Condition in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon under the firſt general Head,<note place="margin">4. End of the Word and Miniſtery.</note> is from the <hi>End</hi> of Gods giving the <hi>Word and the Miniſtery</hi> of it to his People in a ſtate of imperfection; <hi>viz.</hi> For their direction, and for their ſupport in all conditions, till they come to a ſtate of perfection. Eph. 4.11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtery, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of faith, and of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> Till we come where there is no need of <hi>Temple,</hi> no need of Temporal and Spiritual light by a <hi>Medium,</hi> as it is Rev. 21.22, 23 Well then, as long as we live in this life, the Word is written for our direction, and for our ſupport. But how ſhall we be directed or ſupported by it, if we do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it by faith? Heb. 4.2. <hi>The Word profits not, not being mixed with faith.</hi> And indeed, the very <hi>End</hi> why God gives us his written Word, is, That we might lay hold of it by faith, for our comfort in our worſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Joh. 20. laſt, <hi>Theſe things are written, that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life through his Name.</hi> And if this be the main <hi>End</hi> of the Scriptures writing, then there is all the reaſon in the world, we ſhould live by Faith in it: Otherwiſe, we do what we can, to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Scriptures end, and to make it vain. Yea, we <hi>take Gods Name in vain,</hi> if we believe not: for, the Word of God, is the greateſt part of Gods <hi>Name,</hi> by which he makes himſelf and his good Will known to us, (as men are known by their Names) Pſal. 138.2. <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</hi> But he that believes not, vilifies this Word; he looks at it as a
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:118867:223"/>
vain word, and ſo he takes Gods Name in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be you will ſay, How do you know the Scriptures to be the Word of God? If I knew it to be the Word of God indeed, I would not onely l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve by Faith in it, but I would ſay and profeſs (as you do) There was all the reaſon in the world that men ſhould believe it, and live by Faith in it: As it is written, <hi>Let God be true, and every man a liar,</hi> Rom. 3.4.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will not at this time undertake to handle this ſubject at large, as I hope to do hereafter, if God pleaſe to continue life and opportunity: For, I conceive, it is one of the moſt neceſſary foundations to be laid. And for want of ſetling and ramming down this Truth, men become fooliſh builders, they are looſe in the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of Religion, they are looſe in their Faith, and as looſe in their Practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Arguments of four ſorts.</note>There are four ſorts of <hi>Arguments,</hi> (beſides the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit, which is the greateſt of all to them that have it) to prove the Scriptures to be of God: Whereof ſome are drawn from the <hi>Scriptures themſelves;</hi> Some from the <hi>Penmen</hi> thereof;<note place="margin">That the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Word of God.</note> Some from the <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi> or Enemies of the Scriptures; and laſt of all, Some from <hi>God himſelf,</hi> bearing witneſs from Heaven to the Word of his Truth. I ſhall onely ſpeak a little of the firſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some Arguments from the <hi>Scriptures themſelves;</hi> and that,<note place="margin">The Scriptures excellency.</note> Whether we reſpect the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or the excellency of the <hi>Matter</hi> therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, it will plainly evince, they are of God: Had we but time, and were it ſo pertinent to this preſent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to run over all the Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The excellency of the Matter appears,</hi> in the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity, Majeſty, Purity, Verity,</hi> and powerful <hi>Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of the Scriptures. It will be too long to ſpeak of all. I will onely pitch upon one; and that is, The infallible
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:118867:223"/>
                  <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Verity</hi> of the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Verity.</note> which prove them to be of God: And this Truth will appear, both by the <hi>Conſent</hi> of all <hi>parts</hi> generally, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by the fulfilling of the <hi>Prophecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, by the <hi>Conſent</hi> of all the <hi>parts</hi> generally.<note place="margin">Conſent of parts.</note> For doth not <hi>Joſhua</hi> confirm <hi>Moſes?</hi> Do not the <hi>Judges</hi> confirm <hi>Joſhua? Samuel</hi> the <hi>Judges?</hi> And ſo we might run through all the reſt, to the end of the Bible. Do but conſider a little what <hi>ſeveral</hi> Authors have ever writ of the ſame ſubject in any humane Art or Science, which have not differed in ſome particular, and brought probable Arguments on both ſides? Whereas the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, though written by ſeveral men, in ſeveral Ages, and ſeveral Parts of the World, do never <hi>croſs</hi> one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, or call in queſtion what <hi>formerly</hi> had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>It is true, I confeſs, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned and unſtable men,</hi> throughout all Ages, have <hi>wreſted the Scriptures to their own deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.16. But where did ever any <hi>one</hi> holy Penman of <hi>God, Correct</hi> what another of them had written? And the reaſon is, Becauſe however <hi>ſeveral</hi> men wrote <hi>ſeveral</hi> parts of the Scriptures, yet they being all <hi>acted by one and the ſame Spirit,</hi> they had all but one and the ſame <hi>Heart;</hi> and, as I may ſo ſay, one and the ſame <hi>Mouth.</hi> And I may well ſay ſo, Becauſe the Scriptures ſayes it before me, Luke 1.10. <hi>As God ſpake by the mouth of the Prophets, which have been ſince the world began.</hi> Obſerve, There is <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> in the Plural Number, and <hi>Mouth</hi> in the Singular. <hi>All</hi> the Prophets had but one <hi>Mouth;</hi> becauſe they all ſpake one and the ſame Truth, without contradiction of one another. Thus there is a <hi>Conſent</hi> of all the <hi>parts</hi> of Scripture generally, which proves them to be of God.</p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:118867:224"/>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>Conſent</hi> will yet more particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in the fulfilling of each Prophecy therein contained. There hath indeed hardly fallen out any matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the beginning of the World ſet down in the Scriptures, but hath been foretold before the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that ſo, when it came to paſs, men might know and believe, that God is the <hi>God of Truth,</hi> and his Word the <hi>Word of Truth.</hi> To omit the great Promiſe of the Meſſiah, and thoſe other alſo, concerning the calling in of the <hi>Gentiles to be of the Church</hi> and People of God, (which was as unlikely and unprobable to Humane Reaſon in <hi>thoſe</hi> days, as the calling <hi>back of the Jews</hi> to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Chriſt in <hi>theſe</hi> days.) And yet, that God that hath ſo wonderfully and miraculouſly fulfilled the former (and is fulfilling of it to <hi>this</hi> day, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of poor <hi>Indians</hi>) will ere long as gloriouſly fulfil the other; and, it may be, ſome of you that ſtand here ſhall not <hi>taſte of death,</hi> till you ſee theſe things fulfilled: Iſa. 66.8. <hi>Who hath heard ſuch a thing, who hath ſeen ſuch things? Shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day, or ſhall a Nation be born at once?</hi> This is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indeed, and ſhall be for a wonder! And yet, <hi>ſo</hi> it was in the <hi>firſt</hi> Coming of Chriſt; <hi>whole Nations</hi> of the Gentiles were converted all of a ſudden, and ſo it ſhall be at the <hi>ſecond</hi> Coming of Chriſt, or a little before, the Nation of the Jews ſhall be reconverted to God, and <hi>graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in again.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> And the Lord prepare <hi>that</hi> woman for the day of her <hi>Travel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But not to inſiſt any longer upon <hi>theſe,</hi> let us for more particular inſtance, caſt our eyes upon that <hi>Remarkable Prophecy,</hi> 1 King. 13.2. when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had erected an Idolatrous Altar in <hi>Bethel,</hi> for the worſhip of his golden Calf, God ſends preſently a Prophet to him, with this Meſſage, That there ſhould be a <hi>Childe born unto the houſe of David, Joſiah by Name,</hi> and that he ſhould <hi>ſacrifice</hi> or burn upon that <hi>very Altar,</hi> the bones of his Idolatrous
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:118867:224"/>
Prieſts; which was fulfilled a matter of <hi>three hundred years after,</hi> 2 King. 23.15, 16. It is moſt admirable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that not onely the <hi>Judgement</hi> it ſelf, but the very <hi>Name</hi> of the Man ſhould be foretold, by which it was to be put in execution, and <hi>that</hi> ſo many years <hi>before</hi> his Birth.</p>
               <p>Conſider, in the next place, how punctually the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremy,</hi> and others, do ſpeak of the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Captivity, of the number of the years it ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and in the concluſion, of the <hi>means</hi> of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom thence; yea, they ſet down alſo the very <hi>Name</hi> of the man <hi>(Cyrus)</hi> whom God had raiſed up accordingly for their deliverance, Iſa. 44.28. &amp; 45.1, 4.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all, (to inſtance no further) take but a view of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and he may ſerve in ſtead of all: For he foretels what ſhould fall out for the ſpace of <hi>Six hundred years,</hi> in the four great <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the World, the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and the <hi>Roman;</hi> and <hi>that,</hi> ſo punctually and exactly, that he might ſeem rather to have writtten a <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> than a <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Therefore the Scriptures are certainly of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Now if any man ſhall object, and ſay, But who knows whether theſe things were ſo foretold before they came to paſs? It may be, when ſuch things fell out, a Prophecy was afterwards fained, and fathered upon them, to gain more credit to their Writings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, That's a thing altogether impoſſible. For, firſt of all, <hi>That</hi> Prophecy of the Man of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Altar in <hi>Bethel,</hi> it muſt needs be really extant ſo many years before the birth of <hi>Joſiah:</hi> For it is moſt manifeſt, (as well by the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as of all other Nations in the World) That the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Kings and Chronicles were written, and ſet down from year to year, the ſelf-ſame time, that, the things therein ſpecified, were acted and performed.</p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:118867:225"/>
               <p>And as for the Prophecy of the <hi>Captivity,</hi> with their <hi>return</hi> by the help of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it is as impoſſible, it ſhould be feigned after the Event, as the other: And my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is this, Becauſe the People going into Captivity, the Scriptures alſo (the Law and the Prophets) went along with them, and from thence were diſperſed almoſt into all Regions of the World. So that, if any ſuch Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had been thruſt in afterwards, the diſcovery would ſoon have ſhewn the vanity of ſuch a policy.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Hiſtory tells us, That he lived under the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Monarchies: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not poſſible the Prophecy ſhould be feigned after the things were fulfilled. Yea, and we reade of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the Great, that he read at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the things which <hi>himſelf had atchieved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is without all Controverſie, That when <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (who was ſtyled <hi>Ptolomeus Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>) I ſay, when he cauſed the Scripture (and ſo, the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> among the reſt) to be Tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Greek by the Seventy Interpreters, there were then many things in that Prophecy, which were not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, neither could there be the leaſt ſuſpicion of alteration afterwards, in reſpect of the great accompt was made of it. For howſoever, that Learning loving King had in his Library a matter of <hi>Fifty thouſand Books,</hi> yet this of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> he eſteemed the greateſt Treaſure of all the reſt; ſhewing no leſs care in the <hi>Preſervation,</hi> than he had before manifeſted both care and coſt in the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>All theſe things therefore being laid together, it muſt needs follow, That the <hi>Prophecies</hi> were revealed and ſet forth by the <hi>God of Truth;</hi> and ſo the Event confirming the <hi>Prediction,</hi> it doth plainly declare there was no jugling, no deceipt, no cunning device of man, but that the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal was of God.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Scriptures be of God (as appears by
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:118867:225"/>
the infallible Truth and Verity of them) there is all the reaſon in the world, we ſhould believe them. If the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks nothing in vain,</hi> Jam. 4.5. we ſhould hear and receive nothing of it in vain, but live by Faith on every word that God ſpeaks in the Scripture. And that is the fourth Reaſon under the firſt general Head.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Reaſon is this, Becauſe Gods People,<note place="margin">5. Experiments of paſt things.</note> whilſt they live here below, have had (both they and their Fore fathers) manifold <hi>Experiments</hi> of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faithfulneſs for the time paſt, in fulfilling his Word: I mean, the Word of his <hi>Promiſe;</hi> not onely in fulfilling the Word of <hi>Prophecy</hi> in general, (as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the former Reaſon) but alſo in fulfilling the Word of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> as ſhall be made out in this. And hath God made good his Promiſe to ſo many generations for the time paſt? And have we not then great reaſon to live by Faith in the Promiſe of ſuch a God for the time to come? Remember what <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid to the People, Joſh. 21. laſt, and 23.14. <hi>You know in all your hearts, and in all your ſouls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God ſpake concerning you; all are come to paſs unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof.</hi> And this he ſpeakes to this end, that he might perſwade them to live by Faith, and to truſt in the ſame God for the time to come. Therefore, Deut. 7.17. To cure the peoples diffidence and diſtruſt, God puts them in minde of former experiences, <hi>If thou ſhalt ſay in thine heart, Theſe Nations are more than I, how can I diſpoſſeſs them? Thou ſhalt not be afraid of them, but ſhalt well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharaoh and all Egypt; So ſhall the Lord thy God do unto all the people, of whom thou art afraid.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>That</hi> God who hath made good his promiſe in his peoples deliverance for the time paſt, he will do it for the time to come alſo. This was <hi>Davids</hi> gracious Logick; both Reaſon rectified, and <hi>Grace</hi> taught him to argue thus, 1 Sam. 17.37. <hi>The Lord
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:118867:226"/>
that delivered me out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtim. Paul</hi> fetches ſuch another Argument from his deliverance out of the paw or mouth of the Lion: And what of that?<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.</note> Mark his Argument; <hi>The Lord ſhall deliver me from every evil work, and will preſerve me to his heavenly Kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</hi> Obſerve: all theſe holy men of God, by their former experience, were built up in future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and ſo ſhould we be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If you ſhall ſay, Where lies the ſtrength of this Reaſon? <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe God makes good his Word and Promiſe at one time, to ſuch as truſt in him, are we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſure he will make it good at another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ</hi> I anſwer, We may well be aſſured of it, and that upon theſe grounds:</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the <hi>Nature</hi> of Gods <hi>Covenant</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: <hi>His Covenant is an everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Jer. 32.40. His Promiſe is very comprehenſive, it reacheth to all perſons that are heirs of the Promiſe, it belongs to all Saints, Eph 3.18. To all <hi>places</hi> where ere thoſe perſons come, 1 Kings 20 28. To all <hi>times,</hi> Heb. 13.5. Iſa. 40.8 <hi>The Word of God ſtandeth for ever.</hi> Therefore, whom God once delivers in a way of Covenant-mercy, he will for ever deliver.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We may argue from the <hi>Nature of God:</hi> For, were the Covenant made never ſo ſure (like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi>) that it ſhould not be changed, yet if God were of a <hi>changeable</hi> Nature, all were as good as nothing. As we ſee in the Covenants of vain and changeable men, (they ſnap them aſunder as <hi>Samſon</hi> did his cords) But God is an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable God,</hi> and this puts life into that unchangeable <hi>Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not: therefore you Sons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi> He is unchangeable in <hi>all his Attributes,</hi> Unchangeable in his <hi>Love,</hi> Jer. 31.3. In his <hi>Truth,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:118867:226"/>
117.2. In his <hi>Power,</hi> Iſa. 59.1, 2. And therefore by the ſame reaſon that we truſt in God <hi>once,</hi> we have cauſe to truſt in him for <hi>ever.</hi> Iſa. 26.4. <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third and the laſt Argument, is drawn from the <hi>Nature of the Price</hi> paid by Jeſus Chriſt to his Father, for all the good things that he hath promiſed. The price of his <hi>own Blood,</hi> which Blood of his (in the Merit and Value of it) is ever pleading and ſpeaking <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things than that of Abel,</hi> Heb. 12.25. By vertue of his blood, Chriſt pleads thus for each believing Soul, Father, beſtow this Mercy on ſuch a man, for I have paid for that Mercy alſo: And, Father, beſtow ſuch a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance upon him, for I have paid the price for that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance alſo; and ſo for a Thouſand Mercies and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances one after another. As when the Price o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Goſpel condemns the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer <hi>as much</hi> as the Law, and more too.

Sixthly, he ſhall be condemned from the mouth of the <hi>Judge himſelf:</hi> for if the Goſpel do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, Mercy himſelf cannot ſave him; (for God is onely merciful in a Goſpel-way) if the Goſpel do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, the Judge muſt needs condemn him: for, As many as have ſinned <hi>under</hi> the Goſpel, ſhall be judged <hi>by</hi> the Goſpel; as thoſe that have ſinned under the <hi>Law,</hi> ſhall be judged by the <hi>Law:</hi> Rom. 2.12. <hi>For as many as have ſinned without law, ſhall alſo periſh without law; and as many as have ſinned in the law, ſhall be judged by the

As the Juſt <hi>lives</hi> by Faith; ſo the Unbeliever <hi>dies</hi> by his Unbelief. He is ſubject to the <hi>firſt</hi> death in the moſt terrible manner, the ſting was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet pulled out by <hi>ſuch</hi> a man; and he is ſubject to the <hi>ſecond</hi> death, <hi>viz.</hi> Death of the Body and Soul to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where the <hi>worm dies not, and the fire is not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> O who would continue in ſuch a condition! Why do we not cry out of our unbelief to God! Why do we not mourn and weep under the burthen of it!

For he that hath no <hi>Faith,</hi> hath no <hi>Chriſt</hi> he that hath no <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hath no <hi>Life:</hi> The Unbeliever is in a <hi>dead</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he dies by his Unbelief, as the Juſt lives by his Faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſee the miſery of all Unbelievers,<note place="margin">2. Their dead condition.</note> they are in a <hi>dead condition:</hi> If the Juſt lives by Faith, they muſt needs be dead who have no Faith; and that, becauſe they want <hi>that</hi> which ſhould unite them to him who is the Principle of Life: 1 Joh. 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life; he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> Alas poor creature! he is dead while he ſeems to live; he is <hi>dead in ſins and trespaſſes,</hi> Eph. 2.1. He is active indeed, to that which is evil, and that is his miſery: but he is dead to all that is good. As Faith works by love, and ſo ſets love and all other Graces on work: So Unbelief ſets all manner of ſin on work; and <hi>ſin when it is finiſhed,</hi>

                     <hi>bringeth forth death.</hi> Unbelief is the cauſe of all ſin and miſery. As the Juſt lives by his Faith; ſo the wicked man dies by his Unbelief. All ſins are pardonable to him that believes; but Unbelief binds all other ſins upon the Soul to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. O the miſerable condition of all unbelievers!
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:118867:233"/>
and ſuch are we all in our natural condition! Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, and bewail it at the Throne of Grace, That God may give us this excellent gift of Faith, that we may live by Faith upon the living God.</p>

Luke 22.31, 32. you may ſee, Satan was an enemy to <hi>Peters</hi> faith, and ſo to the faith of <hi>every</hi> believer.

Such as profeſs Faith, but live not by it.</note>Secondly, It Reproves ſuch as <hi>profeſs</hi> Faith, but <hi>live</hi> not by it; like a man, that makes profeſſion of ſuch a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but never <hi>works</hi> upon his Trade. So multitudes make a Profeſſion of Faith, and ſay, <hi>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, &amp;c. and in Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> But when they have made this Profeſſion, they <hi>live not</hi> by this faith, which they ſo ſolemnly profeſs. Indeed, many talk of it, but few walk by it: Many <hi>ſwear</hi> by it, few <hi>live</hi> by it. It is a rare thing to finde a man that makes <hi>uſe</hi> of his Faith in all his dealing. Many make uſe of their carnal <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and many make uſe of <hi>Senſe,</hi> but few make uſe of <hi>Faith</hi> in thoſe things which are above the graſp of Senſe and Reaſon. Our Saviour Chriſt might <hi>well</hi> ſay, Luk. 18.8. Nevertheleſs, when the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he <hi>finde</hi> Faith upon the Earth? Look upon the vaſt Globe of the Earth, into what <hi>narrow</hi> compaſs they are brought, that make <hi>any Profeſſion</hi> of the Faith. Doth not the <hi>Turk</hi> poſſeſs the greateſt part of the Eaſtern World? Amongſt thoſe that do profeſs the Faith (for <hi>Name ſake</hi>) how many do fulfil <hi>that ſad</hi> Prophecy of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.1. Now the Scripture ſpeaketh expreſly, <hi>In the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing Spirits, and doctrines of Devils</hi> (or <hi>Daemons) speaking lies in hypocriſie, having their Conſciences ſeared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtrain from meats.</hi> Is not this as lively a deſcription of their <hi>Popiſh Doctrine,</hi> as if the Apoſtle had been alive to ſee what they do, and to hear what they ſpeak at this day? And doth not this Doctrine over-ſpread the greateſt part of the Weſtern World? Beſides whole <hi>Clouds</hi> of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and groſs Opinions ariſing daily out of the <hi>Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit,</hi> and obſcuring, for the <hi>preſent,</hi> the bright Beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs.

                  <p>Again, amongſt thoſe who do profeſs the <hi>true</hi> Faith for the Doctrinal part, and are <hi>well principled</hi> in it, how few are there that <hi>walk up to their Principles,</hi> and ſo <hi>live</hi> by Faith in the <hi>practical</hi> part of their life? <hi>That</hi> ſaying is fulfilled which is written. Tit. 1 laſt, <hi>They profeſs they know God,</hi> (and ſo they profeſs they believe in God) <hi>but in works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</hi> Though they make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith, look upon them in their eating, and drinking, and buying, and ſelling, and diſcourſing, and (in a word) in the <hi>whole Series</hi> of their converſing with men, you ſhall ſee no more of Faith in them, (ſaving the bare Profeſſion) than if they were very heathens. And theſe are the <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort to be Reproved, ſuch as make <hi>Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of the Faith, but they <hi>live</hi> not by it.</p>

As a rich man, that hath wealth enough, and yet is ready to ſtarve himſelf for want of <hi>improving</hi> what he hath: So do ſome men in a <hi>Spiritual</hi> ſenſe: It may be God hath <hi>inrich'd</hi> them with the grace of Faith, and yet at ſome times, and in ſome <hi>caſes</hi> they live as if they had <hi>no faith at all,</hi> as in <hi>difficult</hi> duties, eſpecially in great and <hi>ſudden Trials:</hi> Like a young Fencer,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> when he meets with an <hi>unwonted</hi> ſtroke, he is put beſides his skill, and beſides his ordinary guard, and throws down his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: So did the <hi>Diſciples</hi> upon the ſudden ſtorm, Luk. 8.24. Inſomuch as Chriſt ſays, <hi>Where is your faith?</hi> Faith they <hi>had</hi> indeed, but there was none to be ſeen at <hi>that</hi> time. And therefore in the <hi>other</hi> Evangeliſt, Mark 4.40.

onely in general: Be ſure to diſcharge your Oaths, and a good Conſcience therein, both as Freemen of this <hi>Town,</hi> and as Freemen of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt;</hi> keep to your Charter, and you ſhall not do amiſs. As I take it, you have a <hi>Double Charter;</hi> one, from the higheſt Power upon earth; the other, from Jeſus Chriſt, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth. I ſuppoſe, the firſt of your Charters will direct you to chuſe honeſt and <hi>juſt Men,</hi> in regard of Communicative and Diſtributive Juſtice: I am ſure your <hi>ſecond</hi> Charter (by vertue whereof you are the Freemen of Jeſus Chriſt, and of that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, which is the Mother of us all) I am ſure this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth charge you (as near as you can) to chuſe men fearing God, Religious men, ſuch as you apprehend to be <hi>really</hi> ſo. I know we all <hi>profeſs</hi> Religion, but all do not <hi>walk anſwerably</hi> to their Profeſſion. I would there were not ſome publick Contemners of the Means of grace, and ſuch as commonly and ordinarily walk contrary to the Rule of the Goſpel. You know, it is a Goſpel-Rule given to us Miniſters, <hi>Preach the Word, be inſtant in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, out of ſeaſon;</hi> and therefore you might well ſay, <hi>Woe be to us, if we preach not the Goſpel accordingly.</hi> And ſurely, upon the ſame ground, People are bound to hear in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, in caſe <hi>extraordinary</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions take them not off. I need not tell you, (unleſs it be in way of acknowledgement) the great Charges you are and have been at, for a long time, in maintaining the Publick Ordinance, <hi>twice</hi> in the Week, upon your <hi>ordinary</hi> days.

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:118867:241"/>
of Officers, can ſhew any countenance to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as do uſually diſcountenance and ſlight the Publick Ordinance. If they judge the Ordinance not worthy of their <hi>Preſence,</hi> me thinks others ſhould judge them not worthy of <hi>Publick Truſt.</hi> I confeſs, for my own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, I have not deſired, in ſatifying a curious ear, to ſpeak to you in the <hi>enticing words of mans wiſdome;</hi> yet, I hope, I may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I have endevoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my ſelf to every mans conſcience in the ſight of God.</hi> I deſire to ſpeak nothing but the truth of God in the <hi>patern of wholeſom words;</hi> and that word of Faith, by which every one of you ſhall be judged in the latter day. And in this caſe, <hi>whoſoever deſpiſeth the weakeſt</hi> Meſſenger of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he deſpiſeth Chriſt himſelf;</hi> and whoſoever deſpiſeth Chriſt, you know his doom: My <hi>hearts deſire;</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> to God, is for the contrary.

And when the Miniſtery hath done <hi>all</hi> it can do, ſuch a Soul goes to <hi>God</hi> by Prayer, and ſaith, Lord, give me grace impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to apply the ſearching Word; I have heard this day, nay do thou <hi>thy ſelf</hi> ſearch me, O Lord, examine me, and prove me, try my reins and my heart, Pſal. 26.2. And that's the <hi>firſt</hi> Diſcovery of true Faith and true Grace; It loves to be tried.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>how</hi> ſhall it be tried?</p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:118867:242"/>
                  <p n="2">2. It is tried both by the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and by the <hi>Effect,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. It is known by the Cauſe.</note> which are the beſt means to come to the knowledge of any thing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by the cauſe <hi>Inſtrumental.</hi> It is wrought by the <hi>Word,</hi> Rom. 10.17. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing:</hi> Though other means may help to Faith, <hi>(The converſation of the Wife)</hi> 1 Pet. 3.1. (And the Samaritans believ'd, becauſe of the <hi>Woman,</hi> Joh. 4.42.) Yet, the Word of God is the onely ground of Faith.</p>
                  <p>And this Word works in the whole man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It works in the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It works upon the <hi>Will</hi> a cloſing with the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Promiſe, (ſuppoſe, 1 Pet. 2.6. or Joh. 1.12, &amp;c.) grounding upon his <hi>willingneſs</hi> to receive all ſuch as come to him, upon his <hi>ability</hi> alſo, and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> to make his Word <hi>good.</hi> It receives <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt (Prophet, Prieſt, and King) into the whole man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is tried by the <hi>Fruits</hi> and <hi>Effects,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

                        <hi>Effect</hi> 3.</note>3. A high prizing of the <hi>Image</hi> and likeneſs of Chriſt, the inſeparable <hi>Concomitant</hi> of Faith. The Viſion of Chriſt by Faith, works a ſtrong deſire of <hi>Transformation</hi> into the likeneſs of Chriſt. It is the height of ſuch a Souls <hi>ambition,</hi> to have the <hi>Image</hi> of the Lord Jeſus ſtampt upon it, both in inward impreſſions of <hi>Grace</hi> upon the heart, (to be humble and meek as he was) and in outward expreſſions of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs in their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Pſal. 17. laſt. <hi>When I awake,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I ſhall be ſatisfied with thy likeneſs.</hi> We are now indeed the Sons of God, ſaith S. <hi>John;</hi> but it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be: but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be <hi>like</hi> him, for we ſhall <hi>ſee</hi> him as he is, 1 Joh. 3.2. As if they ſhould ſay, We eſteem this our very <hi>Heaven</hi> and Happineſs, to be made like to Chriſt. A formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor may deſire to be <hi>ſaved</hi> by Chriſt, but he doth not ſeriouſly deſire to be made <hi>like</hi> to Chriſt: So a real Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loves Gods Image in others, 1 Joh. 5.1.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Other effects and fruits of <hi>Faith:</hi> You have in the fruits of the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſet down,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.22.</note> Gal. 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, with peace, long-ſuffering, &amp;c.</hi> And though Faith it ſelf be a fruit of the Spirit, yet thoſe other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces coupled with it, are alſo fruits of Faith in order of working.</p>
                  <p>As for Example:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When a Soul is once <hi>Reconciled</hi> to God by Faith, it cannot chuſe but <hi>love</hi> him: Faith worketh by Love. So far as we have any ſaving <hi>light</hi> from the Spirit, we do alſo receive heat from the Spirit: <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe the Holy Ghoſt is like fire, comes with <hi>heat,</hi> as well as with <hi>light:</hi> Nay, of the two, the heat of our <hi>love</hi> to God, is more ſenſible than the light of our Reconcilement. Many a Soul that is much in the dark concerning <hi>Juſtification,</hi> yet
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:118867:243"/>
cannot but confeſs they <hi>love</hi> God; yea, ſhould God hide his face from them, yet they cannot chuſe but <hi>love</hi> him, for his Holineſs, Truth, Goodneſs, Juſtice, and ſuch other Perfections. And indeed the <hi>ſoundeſt</hi> way to comfort a weak Believer, is, Firſt to convince them of their <hi>love</hi> to God: For upon the manifeſtation of love, in due time, follows <hi>Joy:</hi> That's the ſecond fruit of the Spirit and of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Joy:</hi> for the proof of <hi>our love</hi> to God, doth moſt infallibly prove <hi>his love to us;</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> And ſo far as Gods <hi>love</hi> is cleared to us, we muſt needs <hi>rejoyce,</hi> Luk. 1.47. <hi>My Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour:</hi> So that our <hi>Joy</hi> in God is weaker or ſtronger, not as <hi>Gods love</hi> to us is weaker or ſtronger, but as the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of it is weaker or ſtronger: And what we ſay of Joy, we may alſo ſay of <hi>Peace,</hi> which is the third fruit of the Spirit and of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Peace:</hi> for being juſtified by Faith, we have <hi>peace</hi> with God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom. 5.1. But this Joy and Peace doth not always <hi>immediately</hi> follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believing, but (as the Sun riſing follows the dawning of the day) ſome good diſtance after. However, ſo ſoon as ever we believe we have the <hi>ground-work and ſeed</hi> of Peace, Pſal. 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and joyful gladneſs for the upright in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth fruit is <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> not onely in regard of <hi>Men,</hi> but in reſpect of <hi>God</hi> himſelf: when God carries himſelf as if he were an <hi>enemy</hi> to us, yet we will be <hi>friends</hi> with him, we will make the beſt conſtructions of Gods Corrections,<note place="margin">Iſa. 8.17.</note> and we will wait for the manifeſtation of his love, <hi>who hideth his face from the houſe of Jacob.</hi> As <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf waited many a year, and endured much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the <hi>love</hi> which he did bear to <hi>Rachel:</hi> So will a believing Soul be content to wait with <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> for the love he bears to Jeſus Chriſt: whereas an unbeliever flings away in a chafe, and ſays, <hi>What ſhould I wait for
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:118867:244"/>
the Lord any longer, ſeeing this evil is of the Lord,</hi> 2 King. 6.33.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1. In point of ſins.</note>1.

This is part of the good fight of Faith, 1 Tim. 6.12. though it may be <hi>foiled</hi> by the fleſh, yet it is never <hi>ſo</hi> overcome, but there is a riſing again, and <hi>a luſting of the Spirit againſt the fleſh,</hi> Gal 5.17. <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and other of Gods Saints, were miſerably foiled for the preſent, but yet they roſe again by a renewed act of Repentance and Faith; and ſoon after recovered their former ſtrength: Whereas an Unbeliever, though he may ſometimes have ſome ſtrivings and ſtruglings in his <hi>natural</hi> Conſcience; yet at laſt he gives <hi>quiet</hi> poſſeſſion to Sin and Satan, being reſolved to put himſelf to no further trouble: Luk. 11.21. <hi>When a ſtrong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace: An unbelievers peace is his reſt in ſin,</hi> Prov. 4.16. <hi>But a believers peace is his reſt in Chriſt,</hi> Pſal. 116.11. <hi>and not in ſin,</hi> Pſal. 77.4. &amp; 19 laſt. Job 8.34. Rom. 6.20. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gives quiet poſſeſſion long together, he will not <hi>do the leaſt evil,</hi> that good may come of it; nor <hi>omit the leaſt good,</hi> for fear evil ſhould come of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <note place="margin">2. In point of good actions.</note>2. For <hi>good</hi> Actions. A believer (ſo far as he is himſelf) he does all he doth in the ſtrength of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Therefore the very <hi>firſt act</hi> of Faith, is called a <hi>laying hold</hi> on Gods ſtrength, Iſa. 27.5.

Or if he chance to perform ſome good Duties, yet he doth all in his own ſtrength, as he doth all to his own ends: All is done in the ſtrength of his own parts and preparation: for he perceives not that he is weak, and poor, and blinde, and miſerable, and naked. But a Believer, as he lives upon God, ſo he does all he does in the ſtrength of God: I ſay, ſo far as he is himſelf, he does ſo. And if at any time, or in any duty, he be overtaken with ſelf-confidence, to relie upon the Mountain of his created ſtrength, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Grace, he is never well, till he hath deeply humbled himſelf for it, as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 30.6. And therefore, I ſay, a Believer, ſo far as he is himſelf, does all he doth in the ſtrength of God. If he be to preach, if he be to pray, whatever he be to do, he dares venture upon nothing in his own ſtrength, leſt God ſhould blaſt his endevours in ſtead of bleſſing them [2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God</hi>] Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me:</hi> yea, <hi>bear</hi> all things in the ſtrength of Chriſt, but nothing in his own ſtrength. This is an infallible ſymptome of the Life of Faith, Pſal. 84.5. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſtrength is in thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third and laſt Evidence, hath reſpect <hi>to both:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. In point of both.</note> for whether a Believer be to reſiſt that which is evil, or to perform that which is good, as he goes out in Gods ſtrength: ſo he goes to God by Prayer in both reſpects; for prayer is a calling in of the ſtrength of God: and a believing creature is ever a praying creature, unleſs under Tentation; and therefore, true Prayer is called the Prayer of Faith: and indeed, Prayer is one of the <hi>firſt evidences</hi> of Faith; I do not mean, the Gift of Prayer, whereby we can expreſs our ſelves in good words. But the Spirit
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:118867:245"/>
of Prayer and Supplications, whereby we expreſs our ſelves in good and <hi>child-like</hi> affections. No ſooner hath a man Faith, but together with his Faith, he receives the <hi>Spirit of Adoption, whereby he cries Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, Rom. 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not beleeved,</hi> (they are but poor <hi>formal</hi> Prayers, without Faith) So we may ſay on the other ſide, How ſhall they not call on him, on whom they have believed [2 Cor. 4 13. <hi>We having the ſame Spirit of faith</hi> (according as it is written, <hi>I believe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have I spoken) we alſo believe, and therefore we ſpeak</hi>] none of Gods children are born tongue-ty'd: I am ſure, not ſo hard tyed, but there will be inward ſighs and groans, and wreſtlings with God, when there are no outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions at all. The Spirit of Faith is ever attended with a Spirit of Prayer and Supplication. And this is the laſt Evidence, by which we may judge of unfeigned Faith, from that which is feigned and counterfeit.</p>

That</hi> is true; yet there is ſomething more in Faith than in all the reſt, in tendency to Salvation: For Faith (in order of <hi>working</hi>) is the very <hi>Root</hi> of all other Graces: Our Hope, and Love, and Zeal, and all the reſt, do <hi>ſpring</hi> from our Faith, Rom. 12.3. So far as we believe, we hope; ſo far as we believe, we love; ſo far as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we are zealous for God: and ſo of the reſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith is in a ſpecial manner neceſſary to Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely inſtrument of laying hold upon Chriſt. And therefore in a ſpecial manner are we bound to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is ſuch a Gift,<note place="margin">3. Such a gift as none elſe can give.</note> as is impoſſible for any other to give, but God alone: Therefore it is called, <hi>The faith of the operation of God,</hi> Col 2.12. as if God alone could work it. If an Angel from Heaven ſhould perſwade you to believe this or that, yet if God do not perſwade you by his Spirit, you cannot believe. You reade Luk. 1.20. the Angel tells <hi>Zacharias,</hi> he ſhould be ſtruck dumb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believed not <hi>the words of the Angel.</hi> If all the Angels in Heaven ſhould preach to us, if God himſelf doth not preach to us by his Spirit, we cannot believe. And if all the Angels upon Earth (I mean, all the Miniſters; for they are called the Angels of the Churches) if all theſe one after another ſhould preach to one particular Soul, yet <hi>that</hi> Soul would not believe, unleſs God open the heart of it (as he did the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi>) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> You will ſay, But Experience ſhews, ſuch and ſuch have been Converted by ſuch and ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is granted: but it was <hi>not the man without God, but God in the man</hi> that did it; elſe why is one man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:118867:247"/>
rather than another? Why the <hi>ſame</hi> man at one time, rather than at another, and by means more impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, but to ſhew it is God in the man? <hi>That</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>the faith of Gods people might not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.5. that ſo he might have all the praiſe and glory. Therefore the Apoſtle in this reſpect makes nothing of the Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſter, that <hi>God may be all in all</hi> in all his Miniſters, 1 Cor. 3.5, 6, 7. Who then is <hi>Paul,</hi> and who is <hi>Apollo,</hi> but Miniſters by whom ye believe?</p>
                  <p>And as none can help (as to Faith) but God alone: So we cannot help our ſelves, we cannot work up our own hearts to believe; we are not onely like ſick men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but as dead men in the grave, ſhut up under the grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of Unbelief; [Rom. 11.32. <hi>He hath ſhut up all in unbelief, that he may have mercy upon all</hi>] That is, that Gods mercy might be the more magnified in beſtowing Faith upon them, that were as unable to believe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as a dead man is unable by his own power to ariſe out of his grave.<note place="margin">The wonders of Faith.</note> All the ſteps of Faith are wondrous difficult to a poor Creature; yet know, all things are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible with God.</p>
                  <p>As for Example:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſee and believe what God requires of us in the <hi>firſt</hi> Covenant: For till we know this, we think our ſelves in a good condition, and <hi>alive without the Law,</hi> Rom. 7.9. And we cannot ſee and believe this, till God himſelf open our eyes, 1 Cor. 2.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſee and believe how far we come ſhort of the Law, naturally how ſinful we are, and curſed by ſin: For we are like the young man that ſaid, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth upward:</hi> But till wee ſee our ſelves ſinners, and feel the weight of ſin, we ſhall never look out after a Saviour. <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but the ſick,</hi> Mat. 9.12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſee and believe, that not onely our <hi>groſs ſins,</hi>
                     <pb n="453" facs="tcp:118867:247"/>
but our <hi>beſt Righteouſneſſes</hi> do leave us in a miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>without</hi> a Saviour. This is wondrous difficult: for no ſooner do we attain to ſome <hi>parts,</hi> and the performance of ſome Duties, but we are ready to ſay, with the Church of <hi>Laodicea, I am rich, and increaſed with goods, and ſtand in need of nothing; and perceive not that we are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blinde, and naked:</hi> and it is nothing but Eye ſalve from Jeſus Chriſt, that can make us perceive <hi>this,</hi> Rev. 3.17, 18. that can make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and confeſs, that <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy polluted rags,</hi> Iſa 64.6. This is wondrous hard. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally we are full of <hi>Self-love,</hi> and <hi>Self-admiration;</hi> but a Soul that comes to Chriſt is full of <hi>Self-loathing,</hi> and <hi>Self-deteſtation:</hi> Job 42.6. <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. To ſee and believe the <hi>perfect</hi> Righteouſneſs, and ſurpaſſing Excellency of Jeſus Chriſt. For a <hi>Natural</hi> eye ſeeth no beauty in him, Iſa. 53.2. and yet before we can <hi>deſire</hi> him, we muſt <hi>ſee</hi> the beauty that is in him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To ſee and believe the <hi>Neceſſity and the Duty</hi> of the poor Souls coming to Chriſt, Pſal 2 12. <hi>Leaning</hi> upon him for Righteouſneſs and Salvation; and that ſo doing, it ſhall never be caſt out: For naturally we are ready to think and to ſay, There is no need of coming to Chriſt, or not need of us and our coming. Though God will be merciful to <hi>others.</hi> I am afraid he will not be merciful to <hi>me;</hi> Though he do not caſt out <hi>others</hi> who came to him, I am afraid he will caſt out <hi>me.</hi> Therefore it is the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Work of the Spirit of Chriſt, to <hi>perſwade</hi> the ſin-repenting Soul <hi>to come</hi> to Chriſt, Joh. 6.44. and when it is come, to perſwade it, <hi>that Chriſt will not caſt it out again.</hi> And ſo the Spirit <hi>faſtens the Promiſe</hi> upon the Soul, Joh. 6.36. It is the wonderful Work of the Spirit, to perſwade <hi>enemies</hi> to become <hi>friends;</hi> to perſwade <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to draw nigh, and be <hi>acquainted with Chriſt.</hi> This is ſuch a difficult Work, that it is the Work of a God, and not
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:118867:248"/>
of a Creature: All the Miniſters in the World cannot do it without the Spirit; and therefore it is ſaid, Gen. 9.27. <hi>God inlarge,</hi> or God <hi>perſwade Japhet to dwell in the Tents of Shem.</hi> The Jews came of <hi>Shem,</hi> and were the firſt Church; of <hi>Japhet</hi> came the Gentiles, and they were <hi>ſtrangers to the Common-wealth of Iſrael.</hi> Now it muſt be the Work of an Almighty God, to perſwade them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and ſo to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem.</hi> We are all <hi>naturally</hi> ſo impriſoned and lockt up under Unbelief, that in caſe our hearts are once ſet at liberty to imbrace the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and Chriſt in the Promiſe, we may well ſay, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid when he came to himſelf, and found that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of Priſon, Acts 12.11. <hi>Now I know of a ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Lord hath ſent his Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, &amp;c.</hi> So may a Believer ſay, who is awakened out of his <hi>dead</hi> ſleep, (as <hi>Peter</hi> was) <hi>Now</hi> I know of a ſurety that God hath ſent <hi>his Spirit,</hi> and hath deliverd me out of the hand of the <hi>ſpiritual Herod,</hi> out of the hand of Satan: It is <hi>he</hi> that hath delivered me out of the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of Sin: It is <hi>he</hi> that hath cauſed the <hi>Iron-gates</hi> of my unbelieving heart to fly open of its own accord: It is he, that by the Power of his Spirit hath looſed and ſhaken off all the <hi>Chains and Bolts</hi> of natural Corruptions and ſinful Cuſtoms; what was impoſſible to <hi>me,</hi> God hath made feaſible and eaſie: and therefore to <hi>Him</hi> be all the praiſe and glory, who hath <hi>fulfilled the work of faith with power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.11. Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> who <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> being the ſervant of Sin, and perceiving himſelf redeemed, and manu-mitted by the Power of Gods Grace, he doth freely, in a way of Thankfulneſs, offer up himſelf to the <hi>Service</hi> of God, as if it were his perfect <hi>freedom,</hi> Pſal. 116.16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant, and the ſon of thine handmaid, thou haſt looſed my bonds:</hi> What follows? <hi>I will offer to thee the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Thanksgiving.</hi> And this is the third Conſideration that ſhould move us to be thankful.</p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:118867:248"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, It is ſuch a Gift as is <hi>very precious,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. Faith is a moſt precious gift.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be very thankful for it. It is true indeed, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is very precious, he is ſo in himſelf, whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or no: But he is not ſo to us, unleſs <hi>we imbrace him by faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. This ſets a price upon him to the <hi>purpoſe.</hi> Therefore we ſhould account <hi>that faith</hi> precious, that makes <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſo precious <hi>to our Souls.</hi> Men uſe to be thankful for precious gifts.</p>
                  <p>Now there are three things in Scripture accounted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.<note place="margin">Three things very precious.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>Pearl</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Cabinet</hi> that holds it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The skilful <hi>Hand,</hi> that hath <hi>Right and Power</hi> to open the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> and lay hold upon it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Pearl</hi> it ſelf, <hi>viz Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Mat. 13.45, 46. <hi>ſo</hi> precious, that the Merchant-man is content to ſell all that he hath, ſo he may but <hi>compaſs this</hi> Pearl. Farewel Profits, farewel Pleaſures, farewel Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, farewel Sin, ſo I may but injoy <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I am willing to part with <hi>all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Cabinet</hi> that holds the Pearl, is precious, 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>There are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes, whereby we are made partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> One Promiſe is more worth than all the world. How ſhould we know where to <hi>finde</hi> the Pearl, if God had not laid it up in ſuch a precious <hi>Cabinet!</hi> Therefore the <hi>Cabinet</hi> alſo is precious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>skilful Hand,</hi> which hath Right and Power to open the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> and lay hold upon the Pearl; <hi>that</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> precious hand. Were the <hi>Cabinet</hi> and the <hi>Pearl</hi> never ſo precious, yet if we had no hand to open the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> or lay hold on the <hi>Pearl,</hi> what were we the better? But Faith hath <hi>skill and power</hi> from God to <hi>open</hi> the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> and to <hi>lay hold</hi> upon the Pearl, and to ſay, This is <hi>mine;</hi>
                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:118867:249"/>
and therefore <hi>this</hi> Faith muſt needs be <hi>precious</hi> Faith,<note place="margin">The preciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith in 4 reſpects.</note> 2 Pet. 1.1. It is a precious hand in four reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it lays hold upon <hi>precious things,</hi> Precious <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Precious <hi>Promiſes,</hi> Precious <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Holineſs:</hi> For we are juſtified by Faith, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Faith, as we have already proved at large.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe in caſe it lays hold on things <hi>not precious,</hi> it <hi>makes</hi> them precious. As it makes <hi>difficult things eaſie</hi> (all things are poſſible to him that believeth) ſo it makes <hi>vile things become precious,</hi> Rom. 8.28. <hi>And this we know</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that all things work together for good to them that love God:</hi> 'Tis all one, as if he had ſaid, To them that believe in God. For Faith worketh by love, it turneth Iron-fetters into Golden chains. There is much talk of the <hi>Philoſphers Stone,</hi> what great wonders it would do, if it could be found out: But this is true of Faith, <hi>It turneth all that it toucheth into that, which is moſt precious.</hi> It was fabled of <hi>Midas,</hi> That it was his deſire, whatever he touch'd might be turned into Gold: he had his deſire; and yet he repented himſelf when he had done, (ſay they) <hi>Becauſe his very meat was turned into gold, that ſhould have preſerved his life.</hi> But, whatever a <hi>Believer</hi> touches by Faith, if it be not turned into Gold, it is turned into that which is more precious than Gold. Suppoſe he meet with Poverty, or with Bonds, and Impriſonment, <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that this ſhall turn to my ſalvation, through your prayers, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.19. And thus Faith is precious, for it maketh even <hi>vile things become precious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe it lays hold on precious things <hi>for it ſelf.</hi> The <hi>Maſter</hi> of a Ship may carry abundance of Treaſure for <hi>another</hi> man: But whatever precious things Faith lays hold on, it makes them <hi>its own. My God, and my Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Thomas: I live by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, who hath loved me, and given himſelf for me. My beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> My Chriſt, My Promiſe, My

Heaven: <hi>All is mine,</hi> ſaith Faith. <hi>All things are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe it lays <hi>faſt hold,</hi> it lays hold <hi>for ever</hi> on thoſe precious things. If a Believer ſhould lay hold, <hi>and let go again,</hi> his Faith were not ſo precious. Nay, the more happy a man eſteems himſelf in the enjoyment of a good thing the more miſerable he apprehends himſelf to be in the <hi>loſs of it.</hi> But Faith lays hold upon Chriſt <hi>for ever: Once thine, and for ever thine:</hi> for, The Juſt lives by Faith the Life of <hi>Conſervation</hi> or <hi>Perſeverance.</hi> It may be, thou art afraid thou ſhouldſt let <hi>thy hold go of Chriſt.</hi> But to be ſure, Chriſt will never let <hi>his hold go of thee;</hi> yea, he will eſtabliſh and confirm thy hold of him. Phil. 1.6. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you, will perform or finiſh it, until the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Ye are kept by the power of God through faith unto Salvation.</hi> Job 17.9. <hi>The righteous ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the fourth reſpect, wherein Faith is ſuch a precious Gift, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith lays hold on Chriſt, and conſequently on whatſoever is precious, <hi>ſo as never to let go its hold:</hi> which Conſideration ought to excite our Thankfulneſs for ſo rich a Jewel as Faith. which everlaſtingly entails all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. and laſtly, We ſhould be Thankful for Faith,<note place="margin">5. Faith is rare.</note> becauſe it is ſo rare, and ſcarce to be found: This Flower grows not in every Garden. We ſhould indeed be Thankful for good things, though they are common: but I know not how it comes to paſs, we take little notice of ſuch Mercies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong outward things, what more precious than the Sun, the Air, and the Water? and yet becauſe they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, how few are affected with Gods goodneſs in theſe things, as they ought to be? But what is ſcarce and hard
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:118867:250"/>
to be found, we are uſually much taken with ſuch a thing, and can prize the Donor of it. Now ſuch a thing is true Faith, its very hard to be found: <hi>When the Son of Man cometh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 18.8.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall he finde Faith upon the earth?</hi> Doubtleſs, many may be found that have the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of Faith in their mouths, but few that have the <hi>Grace</hi> of Faith in their hearts, or the <hi>Fruit</hi> of Faith in their lives: As there are <hi>few that ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſo there are few that do truly believe: for, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16. Now of thoſe few, there are very few <hi>wiſe, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and noble,</hi> upon whom God beſtows this precious Gift of Faith. A poor deſpicable creature, that hath obtain'd Faith at Gods hands, may ſay, Bleſſed be God, though I have but little in the world, yet God hath given me that which he hath denied to many wiſe, and mighty, and noble men in the world. Therefore ſuch a man hath great cauſe to be thankful, to be thankful, I ſay, even to admiration: Joh. 14.22. <hi>Lord, how is it that thou doſt manifeſt thy ſelf unto us, and not unto the world?</hi> This is that, for which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is ſo thankful to his heavenly Father, Mat. 11.25. <hi>At that timt Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto babes; even ſo, Father, becauſe it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> Here is ſomething very remarkable in the ſpeech of Chriſt, which we ſhall take notice of in the Reſolution of two queſtions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Why it is ſaid, <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered,</hi> when we reade not any body ſaid any thing to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, S. <hi>Luke</hi> will reſolve this queſtion, Luk. 10.21. <hi>In that hour Jeſus rejoyced in the Spirit, and ſaid, I thank thee, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve: God ſpake joy to his Soul inwardly, though nothing was ſpoken outwardly, even ſuch joy as makes men exult or leap for joy (as the word ſignifies) And in anſwer to this inward work of
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:118867:250"/>
joy, <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. But then ſecondly, it may be queſtioned, Why an inward anſwer of Thankfulneſs, might not ſerve the turn to an inward voice of joy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> For this, we muſt know, Chriſt doth return his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in an audible voice, <hi>for their ſakes that ſtood by,</hi> (as he ſaid in another caſe, Joh. 11.42.) <hi>viz.</hi> To ſtir up the Diſciples, and all Gods People, to be the more thankful for ſuch a choice and ſingular Mercy; He ſets before us a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Thankfulneſs; he tells us what we ſhould be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for, above all other things, namely, That God hath revealed to us the great Myſtery of Salvation: And how is this revealed, but by Faith? and why ſhould we be ſo thankful for the revelation of this Myſtery by Faith? even becauſe there are ſo few that do believe, it is a Myſtery that is <hi>hid from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed to</hi> a few <hi>babes,</hi> that have no more knowledge of heavenly things by nature, than if they were babes. It is kept ſecret from the <hi>wiſeſt</hi> part of the world, and from the <hi>greateſt</hi> part of the world: And therefore if Faith be ſo rare and ſcarce, as well as precious, we have the greater cauſe to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Each true Believer may ſtand and wonder, and ſay, Lord, who am I, that whilſt ſo many Millions go in <hi>the broad way that leads to deſtruction,</hi> who am I, that I ſhould be one of thoſe few that do <hi>believe, to the ſaving of the ſoul,</hi> Heb. 10.39.</p>

We ſtartle at Murther, Adultery, Theft, &amp;c. and good reaſon we ſhould do ſo: in the mean time, it may be, we are little troubled that we do not believe; nay, it may be we think we do well to doubt of the Promiſe, as <hi>Jonah</hi> thought he did well to be angry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The evil of Unbelief.</note>And yet this ſin of Unbelief exceeds all other ſins in ſome reſpect.</p>
                  <p>For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. It diſhonours God.</note>Firſt, it is a ſin that doth exceedingly <hi>diſhonour</hi> God. Indeed, it calls the Divinity it ſelf in queſtion: for if God be not a God of Unchangeable Truth, and of Infinite Power, he is as good as no God: But Unbelief queſtions the Truth of God. God ſaith, He that <hi>truſts</hi> in him, <hi>ſhall not be confounded:</hi> But ſaith the Soul, Though I ſhould caſt my ſelf upon his Promiſe, I queſtion whether it ſhould be made good to me: Thus, 1 Joh. 5.10. <hi>He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not God, hath made him a liar.</hi> So Unbelief another while queſtions the Power of God: <hi>Can God prepare a Table in the Wilderneſs?</hi> and the like: Can God forgive, or can God ſubdue ſuch ſins? Now what a diſhonout is this to God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. It grieves the Spirit of God.</note>Secondly, it's a ſin that doth exceedingly <hi>grieve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</hi> When King <hi>Ahaz</hi> would not believe the comfortable Promiſe that was brought to him from God by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> what ſaith the Scripture? Iſa. 7.13. <hi>Is it a ſmall thing for you to weary or grieve men, but ye will weary my God alſo?</hi> And with whom was God grieved <hi>fourty years in the Wilderneſs?</hi> was it not with them that <hi>ſinned through <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> Heb. 3.17. Suppoſe a rich man ſhould freely invite all the Poor of ſuch a Town to a feaſt, with Promiſe of kind and hearty welcome, if they will but come, &amp;c. Upon the Invitation, firſt one, and then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:118867:251"/>
ſhould begin to make exceptions againſt themſelves, and ſay, Surely he did not intend that I ſhould come, &amp;c. If I do, I'll be ſure to eat nothing: I cannot think he ſhould bid me welcome; or if he do, that he means as he ſays: I am ſo unworthy, I have nothing to pay for my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Would not this grieve the Maſter of the Feaſt, and diſpleaſe him? Might not his diſpleaſure turn into wrath? Luk. 14.21, 24. The Maſter of the houſe was angry, and ſaid, <hi>None of thoſe men which were bidden ſhall taſte of my Supper.</hi> Doth God ſay, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him eat of the bread, and drink freely of the water of life,</hi> Iſa. 55 1. Rev. 22.17. and ſhall any of us ſay, Though I hunger and thirſt alſo, I cannot believe the Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me? How do we quench and grieve the Spirit of God by our Unbelief?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. It pleaſes the Devil.</note> it's a ſin that doth exceedingly <hi>pleaſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> It was the very firſt ſin he tempted our firſt Parents to, and 'tis the main of all his Temptations to this day. Let the Word be preach'd never ſo powerfully; yea, But is this true, ſaith the Devil? The Devil doth what he can to bring God out of credit with his People. Luke 8.12. <hi>Theſe by the high-way are they that hear; then cometh the Devil, and taketh the Word out of their hearts, leſt they ſhould believe and be ſaved.</hi> Mark: the Devil knows that without Faith there is no Salvation: therefore he that is an enemy to the Salvation of People, is as great an enemy to Faith. Thou canſt not do a greater pleaſure to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, than to ſay, I queſtion whether this be true or no: or whether God will make this Promiſe good to me, though I ſhould caſt my ſelf upon the Word of his Free-grace. O Chriſtians! think of this, think ſeriouſly of this, how you rejoyce that wicked Spirit <hi>(The Father of Lies)</hi> and how you grieve and vex the holy Spirit of God <hi>(The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth)</hi> by your Unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider the ſin of Unbelief, 'tis a <hi>Mother Sin.</hi> As the Devil is the Father: ſo Unbelief is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:118867:252"/>
of all other ſins.<note place="margin">The brood of Unbelief.</note> Unbelief was firſt the Devils <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard,</hi> and then he makes it his <hi>Concubine;</hi> and by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation upon an unbelieving heart, he begets a world of other ſins.</p>
                  <p>As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Ignorance.</note>Firſt of all, <hi>Wilful and affected Ignorance:</hi> For if the Devil can but perſwade a Soul, either that the Word is not of God, or that it belongs not to it ſelf in particular; then the next Temptation is, To what purpoſe ſhouldſt thou labour for the knowledge of ſuch a Word that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thee not? And therefore Unbelief and Ignorance are coupled together, and both proceeding from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>But if, &amp;c. in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them:</hi> Whereby it comes to paſs, that ſo many are ignorant, in the midſt of ſo much light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. Security.</note>Secondly, another dangerous ſin (the off-ſpring of the Devil and of Unbelief) is, <hi>Sinful Security.</hi> The Devil begets this ſin upon an Unbelievers heart, and when he hath done, he rocks the Cradle. When God threatens, and the awakened Conſcience begins to <hi>cry;</hi> then, Peace, peace,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note> ſaith the Devil: <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall die, if ye eat of the forbidden fruit?</hi> I ſay, <hi>Ye ſhall not die; The words of the Prophets are but wind:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 5.13.</note> what need ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or fear the threatning. Indeed God hath ſaid, <hi>The Drunkard ſhall be clothed with rags;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 33.21. Iſa. 33.1.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſpoiler ſhall be spoiled;</hi> and, <hi>The flying Roll of Gods curſe ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the houſe of the Thief, and of him that ſweareth falſly by the Name of God,</hi> Zech. 5.4. But do you not ſee, threatned folk live long, ſaith the Devil? Doth not many a Drunkard, Oppreſſor, Thief, and Swearer, live many a fair day? And thus the poor Soul is preſently rock'd aſleep again in its Unbelief, and becomes reſolute in an evil way. Eccl. 8.11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:118867:252"/>
speedily executed, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi> They are ſecure in the midſt of danger, they fall aſleep upon the top of the Maſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Worldlineſs.</note> another dangerous ſin ſpringing from Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, is <hi>Worldly-mindedneſs:</hi> for if we believe not what is promiſed concerning Heaven, or what is threatned in regard of Hell; why then, ſaith <hi>Demas, let us embrace this preſent world.</hi> Let <hi>Noah</hi> preach of Judgement to the old World, and righteous <hi>Lot</hi> to the Sodomites, ſo long as their words ſeem to them <hi>as idle tales,</hi> there's no care to prevent the imminent Judgement, but all their care is how they ſhall live another day, when it may be they have not a day to live: <hi>They ate, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded:</hi> they were all for the world, even to the very day that thoſe dreadful Waters upon the one, and that terrible Fire upon the other, came down from the Lord out of Heaven: And all this becauſe of their Unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Hypocriſie.</note> another dangerous ſin (the fruit of ſuch a curſed Parent) is, <hi>Groſs Hypocriſie.</hi> Counterfeit Faith ever ſprings from real Unbelief: for durſt a man make ſhew of Religion to ſerve his own turn, and to ſerve his own luſts, (as many men do) if he did believe that God was a God <hi>ſearching the heart and the reins,</hi> and ſuch an one as would <hi>ſmite all painted walls, and whited ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,</hi> he durſt as well eat fire as do ſuch a thing. O, ſaith many a vile wretch, I carried my ſelf like a Saint, whilſt I was in their company; and yet it may be the ſame man at another time, and in another company, carries himſelf more like a Devil incarnate, than a Saint: And why ſo? from whence ſprings this groſs Hypocriſie, but from groſs Unbelief? For had he but Faith to believe the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence of God, he would labour to be the ſame at all times, and in all companies.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Hereſie.</note> another dangerous ſin (the Daughter both of
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:118867:253"/>
Unbelief and Hypocriſie) is, <hi>Hereſie;</hi> a departing from the Faith in ſome Points of Religion, for a mans own out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage. For if a man believe not what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, to be true, he will be ſoon ready either to lay down or to take up Opinions, as he may beſt ſerve the preſent time for his own intereſt. In this reſpect an Unbeliever is a Time-ſerver: 1 Tim. 4.2. <hi>He ſpeaks lies in hypocriſie.</hi> If any new Doctrine may but ſwell the man up in his own Name, or in his Eſtate, he makes no bones of it, to <hi>speak lies in hypocriſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">6. Apoſtacy.</note>Sixthly, another dangerous ſin (the fruit of Unbelief and of Hereſie) is, <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> or falling off from the Truth. For by the ſame reaſon that an Unbeliever may fall from one Article of his profeſſed Faith, he may come in time to fall from all. For if his Religion be no more but a State-Profeſſion; then, in caſe the State changeth Religion where he lives, his Religion is changed alſo. And ſuch is the Religion of all ſuch People as are either <hi>extremely ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or <hi>extremely wiſe,</hi> (I mean) <hi>worldly</hi> wiſe, they know no other Religion than the State owns, and that's as good as no Religion at all; becauſe the State owns it, it is vain to him: For though that be ſuppoſed to be true which the State owns; yet when a man owns it not, becauſe it is true, but becauſe the State owns it,<note place="margin">Iſa. 29.13. Mat. 15.9.</note> it is vain to him <hi>In vain,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>do they worſhip me, whilſt their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">7. Atheiſm.</note>The ſeventh and the laſt dangerous ſin, is down-right <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> when men grow to that height of Profaneneſs, to deny God and his Word. Lo, here's <hi>deſcenſus Averni,</hi> thoſe ſlippery and dangerous ſtairs of Unbelief,<note place="margin">Prov. 5.5.</note> by which men <hi>depart from the living God,</hi> and go down to Hell. Heb. 3.12. <hi>Take heed, brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</hi> And thus you ſee this ſin of Unbelief its a Mother ſin, its exceeding prolifical in a dangerous brood of Vipers, that without Repentance will ſting the ſinner to death.</p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:118867:253"/>
                  <p>And further, as Unbelief is a fertile Mother to all ſin: ſo 'tis a cruel <hi>Stepmother to all Grace.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Unbelief a Step-mother to Grace.</note> An Unbeliever can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love God, becauſe he cannot caſt himſelf upon the love of God. Joh. 5.42. Chriſt ſaith to the unbelieving Jews, <hi>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</hi> An Unbeliever cannot ſubmit with patience to the afflicting hand of God; and therefore <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring</hi> againſt God, are ever joined together. An Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer cannot pray for what he wants: Prayer is the daughter of Faith; <hi>How ſhall they call on him, on whom they have not believed?</hi> Rom. 10. An Unbeliever cannot be thankful for any mercy received: unleſs by Faith a man ſees his intereſt in the Giver, he can never be thankful for the Gift. Pſal. 118.28. <hi>Thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee; thou art my God, I will exalt thee:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Lord, thou haſt beſtowed thy ſelf, as well as thy Benefits upon me; and therefore I have found in my heart to praiſe thy Name In a word, an unbeliever cannot perform any acceptable ſervice to God; you muſt make the <hi>tree good,</hi> before the fruit can be good, Mat. 7 18. and we are onely made good trees by Faith: For by Faith we are grafted or planted into Chriſt, without whoſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence we can bring forth no acceptable fruit to God. Joh. 15.3. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you: as the branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</hi> We may indeed bring forth <hi>wilde grapes,</hi> and ſowre grapes of our ſelves; but the ſweet grapes of New Obedience, and ſuch as may be pleaſant to Gods own palate, we can never bring forth, till we are planted into Chriſt by Faith: <hi>For without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this, in the ſixth place,<note place="margin">6. Unbelief the Nurſe of ſin.</note> That as unbelief is the Mother of all ſins: ſo it is the <hi>Nurſe</hi> that maintains and keeps life in every ſin, it binds every ſin upon the Soul, both in the guilt and power of it. Where there is no Faith, there can be no true evidence of forgiveneſs of ſins:
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:118867:254"/>
for, <hi>Men receive forgiveneſs of ſins by faith in Chriſt,</hi> Acts 26.18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">7. Judgments on unbelievers.</note>Seventhly, and laſtly, conſider the Judgement that hangs over the heads of unbelievers, if it be but partial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, I mean, the diſtruſting of God in any particular Promiſe (though we have Faith in the main to believe the reconcilement of our perſons to God) yet even that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial unbelief may deprive us of many ſweet mercies on this ſide heaven. Iſa. 30.15. <hi>In quietneſs and confidence ſhall be your ſtrength.</hi> A man of an unquiet and unbelieving Spirit, may create much trouble to himſelf in this preſent life. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a man in the ſtate of Grace yea, and in ſo great favour with God, that the Scripture gives this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of him, Deut. 34.10. <hi>There aroſe not a Prophet ſince in Iſrael like unto Moſes, whom the Lord knew face to face.</hi> Yet this <hi>Moſes</hi> for a particular paſſage of unbelief, in ſpeaking haſtily to the people,<note place="margin">Num. 20.8, 11.12.</note> when he ſhould have ſpoke to the Rock; and in <hi>ſtriking</hi> the Rock, when he ſhould but onely have <hi>ſpoke</hi> to it; I ſay, for this particular paſſage of unbelief, he was ſhut out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> though he was not ſhut out of Heaven: yea, though he had a ſtrong deſire to enter in, and expreſt this deſire by an earneſt Prayer; Deut. 3.25, &amp;c. <hi>I pray thee let me go over, and ſee the good land that is beyond Jordan, that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mountain, and Lebanon.</hi> Lo, this was his laſt and great requeſt to God; yea, but for all that, he muſt not go over: for ſo it followed in the Text, <hi>But the Lord was wroth with me for your ſakes, and would not hear me; and the Lord ſaid unto me, Let it ſuffice thee, speak no more unto me of this matter, thou ſhalt not go over this Jordan.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> may thank his unbelief for all this: Numb. 20.12. <hi>The Lord ſpake unto Moſes and Aaron, Becauſe ye believed me not, to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the children of Iſrael, therefore ye ſhall not bring this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation into the land which I have given them.</hi> And thus you ſee, that even partial unbelief may deprive us of
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:118867:254"/>
many ſweet mercies on this ſide Heaven. How many thouſands, as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> were cut ſhort of <hi>Canaan</hi> for their unbelief, and murmuring againſt God? And the Lord forgive the ſin of this <hi>preſent Generation</hi> in this reſpect, who are even ready to run back into <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe God hath brought them into the Wilderneſs, in the preſent Diſpenſations of Providence.</p>
                  <p>O the danger of unbelief, though it be but in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Promiſe! O how dangerous then is that total and univerſally reigning Unbelief, when we believe nothing at all, when we have not ſo much as laid hold of any Promiſe to make peace with God! Partial unbelief deprives us of many Mercies on this ſide Heaven; but total unbelief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives men of Heaven it ſelf: Mark 16.16. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> O the miſery of that poor Soul, that never yet believed one Promiſe! O that we could even with Soul-bleeding tears bewail our unbelief! O that God would give to each of us a heart to get into a corner, and to weep in ſecret over our unbelief, each man bemoaning himſelf as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, Jer. 31.18. O that I ſhould have ſuch a ſtiff neck, ſuch a baſe hard unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart! O that I ſhould ſpend ſo much time to ſo little purpoſe, for death hath poſſeſt all that part of my life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was an unbeliever. The heathen man could ſay, O Friends, we have loſt a day! but many of us may ſay, O Friends, we have loſt many days, and many years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have done God little or no ſervice; nay, a great deal of diſſervice by our unbelief! O that I ſhould be ſo <hi>fooliſh and ſlow of heart to believe all that Lord hath ſpake by his Prophets and Apoſtles!</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 24.25.</note> O how juſtly may God <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid me for my unbelief,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I ſhould be ſo backward to believe the God of Truth, and ſo forward to believe the Father of Lies!

                     <hi>thy faith hath ſaved thee;</hi> and, <hi>Thy faith hath healed thee.</hi> Faith is a Remedy againſt all diſeaſes: yea, ſuppoſe a faithful man dies of his diſeaſe, yet his Faith is a Remedy againſt death it ſelf. Woe is me, ſaith the natural man, there is no friend againſt death: But bleſſed be God, ſaith the true believer, for <hi>to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.21.</note> The greateſt of evils, is turn'd into the greateſt good by Faith; even death it ſelf is made advantage. Who would not labour for ſuch a Grace? What ſhould I ſay, to raiſe the price of Faith in your eſteem: What do we eſteem inſtead of Faith? Certainly the beſt of men, and the beſt of bleſſings, are but dead things without Faith: Faith puts life into a man, and into all that a man enjoys; <hi>Without faith, men of high degree are a lie;</hi>

Jon. 2.8. <hi>They that follow after ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities, forſake their own mercy.</hi> If thou wouldſt not forſake thine own mercies, labour for Faith. He is merciful to the purpoſe, that is <hi>merciful to his own Soul,</hi> Prov. 11.17. and that man is the moſt deſperate Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, that is willing to live and die in his unbelief. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, I beſeech you Friends, liſten to the voice of your Immortal Souls: Me-thinks every man now and then ſhould hear the voice of his precious Soul, crying out in this manner, Am I not the moſt excellent piece of Gods Workmanſhip? And did God make me ſo for nothing? Is not my being to continue to everlaſting? Do I not feel in my ſelf the very ſpark of Immortality? Muſt I not be either happy or miſerable to all Eternity? Is there but one means under Heaven to make me happy, which is to get Faith; and ſhall I neglect that? Is this the great Work that God hath given me in charge, that I ſhould <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him whom he hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 6.29. and ſhall I do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe before I do this?

Shall the blood of this Immortal Soul cry out againſt me to all Eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would not hear the cry of it in time? And I pray you, what's the cry of the Soul when it is moſt it ſelf? O give me Chriſt, ſaith the enlightned Soul, or <hi>elſe I die!</hi> Give me Faith to apply him, or I am undone for ever! I beſeech you in this caſe, do not ſtop the mouth of your Souls with Profits and Pleaſures, and ſuch kinde of Traſh, which is not fit meat for an Immortal Soul to feed upon, but labour to get that which thy Soul cries for, that thou maiſt ſay,<note place="margin">Pſa. 116.7.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>O conſider it, friends, in time; if you get Faith, you are made for ever; if you live and die without it, you have undone your ſelves to all Eternity. The Heathen won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to ſee how much one man excell'd another. It's moſt true in regard of Faith; How much doth a Believer excel an Unbeliever! When God weighs men in the Balance, he <hi>weighs their Spirits,</hi> Prov. 16.2. and when he weighs their Spirits, he ponders how much Faith is in their Spirits: <hi>O woman, great is thy faith;</hi> great is thy Faith in me, and ſo great is my eſteem of thee, <hi>Be it unto thee, even as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 15.28.

Omnipotency in Faith.<note place="margin">Mark. 9.23.</note> 
                     <hi>All things are poſſible to him that believeth,</hi> becauſe faith in the promiſe beleeving the truth of God, it alſo ſets the power of God on work in way of providence. It engageth God accordinge to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mife to take part with a weake beleeving Creature, and ſo it doth things above created ſtrength in the power of God. As that witty childe ſometimes ſaid he could rule all <hi>Athens;</hi> for, ſaith he, I can rule my Mother, and my Mother can rule my Father, and my Father can rule <hi>Athens:</hi> So Faith can go as far as the Promiſes, and the Promiſe can go as far as we can ask or think, and farther too, and that's as much as is any ways needful for the good of the Church, or of any particular Member thereof in any condition they can be caſt into: And what can we deſire more, than to have whatever we deſire, that may be for Gods glory, or our own good. And hence it is that Faith is ſo powerful in Prayers for the obtaining of good, and for the removing of evil, and for the ſubduing of enemies. Men that are ſtrong in the Faith, are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Prayer: The Prayer of Faith <hi>draws near with holy boldneſs to the Throne of Grace,</hi> Epheſ. 3.12. And it will have no nay; <hi>Let me go, ſaith God;</hi> I will not let you go, ſaith Faith, except you bleſs me, Gen. 32.26. It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous large Promiſe, that Chriſt makes to a believing Prayer: Mark 11.24. <hi>What things ſoever ye deſire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them.</hi> We reade of <hi>

And thus <hi>the Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower,</hi> Prov. 18.10. Faith is like a mighty Engine, planted upon the top of this Tower, which lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of the Promiſe of God, ſends forth ſuch a volley of ſhot, ſuch a volley of Prayers, that it fires the power of God againſt the enemies, and diſcomfits mighty, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Devil himſelf cannot ſtand before a Prayer

                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.9. Jam. 4.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will fly from you.</hi> And although we have that within us, that is worſe than the Devil (our own corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions) for all the Devils in Hell could not hurt us, had they not intelligence from, and compliance with our own corrupt and deceitful hearts within us) yet even thoſe ſtrong corruptions of ours, like the mighty walls of <hi>Jeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> ſhall fall down by degrees before the Prayer of Faith. Hebrews 11.30. <hi>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after they were compaſſed about ſeven days.</hi> And what if in ſtead of ſo many days, it proves ſo many years, or ſo many weeks of years, yet down they ſhall, as ſure as God hath ſpoken it, if we can but believe it: Mic. 7.19. <hi>He will ſubdue our iniquities.</hi> Corruption is not ſo ſtrong to reſiſt Faith, but Faith is ſtronger for the ſubduing of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. If you ſpeak of ſtrength, a true Believer is ſtrong indeed, he triumphs over Sin, over Satan, over the World <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5 4. In a word, <hi>Tantum poſſumus, quantum credimus:</hi> The Chriſtian can do as much as he can believe upon good grounds;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.37.</note> He is <hi>more than a Conqueror</hi> through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus: Whereas an unbeliever is a poor weak creature; Ezek. 16.30. <hi>How weak is thy heart?</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the ſtate of her Apoſtacy and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. Unbelief cuts the very ſinews of the Soul; it enervates the ſtrongeſt Arm of created ſtrength; nay, it weakens the Arm of Chriſt himſelf. It is a ſtrange paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that you reade, Mark 6.5, 6. <hi>He could there do no mighty work, becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> As unbelief binds our hands from doing ſervice to Chriſt: ſo unbelief binds Chriſts hands from doing good to us, till ſuch time as he is pleaſed to ſet us at liberty to believe.

                     <note place="margin">2. Wiſdom.</note> If you ſpeak of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he is wiſe indeed, who puts his truſt in the Lord, and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:118867:258"/>
lives by Faith in him. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of a wiſe man, who under God, lives <hi>by his wiſdom,</hi> and preſerves the life of others, Eccleſ. 9.15. And ſo <hi>the Juſt lives, &amp;c.</hi> And of <hi>four</hi> deſpicable creatures, that yet are admirable for <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Prov. 30.23, &amp;c. <hi>There be four things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which be little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wiſe;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, he tells us the <hi>Conies</hi> (or as ſome reade it) the Mice of the Mountains) <hi>are a feeble people, yet they make their houſes in the Rocks;</hi> that ſo the ſtrength of the Rock may ſupply the defect of ſtrength in themſelves. And indeed, there is the wiſdom of a true believer, he is a wiſe builder, that builds his <hi>houſe upon the Rock,</hi> Mat. 7.24. and <hi>that Rock is Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4. And he that believes in him, builds upon him; and he that builds upon him, ſhall never fall, <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt him,</hi> and therefore he is a wiſe builder: Pſal 125. <hi>They that truſt in the Lord ſhall be as Mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever:</hi> whereas he is a fool with a witneſs, who deſpiſing this Rock by his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, builds Caſtles in the Air, truſting to his Wit, or Wealth, or created Strength in time of need. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the former part of the Verſe, <hi>his Soul which is lifted up,</hi> in <hi>Arce,</hi> as in a Tower of created Confidence, <hi>his Soul is not right,</hi> he is not right in his wits indeed: But <hi>the juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> becauſe he is ſo wiſe to build upon the true Rock; the other is a Fool, he is Chronicled for a <hi>Fool,</hi> that truſts to his wealth, Luke 12.20. And the wiſe man ſets out the folly of ſuch perſons, who truſts in any thing but the Name of the Lord, which is the onely ſtrong Tower of Safety; and therefore in the very next words he hath this expreſſion, Prov. 18.11. <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City, and an high wall in his own conceit.</hi> Mark thoſe words, <hi>in his own conceit:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, What a mad conceit is this, for a man to truſt to his wealth; there's no man would ever do ſo: he is a very conceited fool, that puts his truſt in his wealth; but
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:118867:258"/>
he is a wiſe man, that <hi>lives by faith,</hi> and <hi>puts his truſt in the Name of the Lord:</hi> This man builds upon the Rock indeed, but the other is a fooliſh builder, for he layeth his foundation in the <hi>Sands,</hi> in the quickſands of worldly Comforts, that are here to day, and gone to morrow. Do we prize Wiſdom? Then, O let us prize Faith. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the wiſe Virgins were the believing Virgins; the fooliſh Virgins were the unbelieving Virgins: They had Lamps indeed, but they had no Oil; they made Profeſſion of Faith in their lives, but they had no truth of Faith in their hearts. Wicked men indeed account Gods people very fools, becauſe they live all upon Promiſe from God, and refuſe the preſent Profits and Pleaſures of ſin. But let them ſay what they will, you muſt give loſers leave to talk, they ſhall one day befool themſelves. When all is done, the believer will prove the wiſe man in the end: for when he that is ſo wiſe, to make himſelf ready beforehand to go in with the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> ſuch as are unprepared ſhall be <hi>ſhut out,</hi> like fools as they are.

He is made their <hi>Counſellor</hi> in all their doubts, that is his <hi>Name,</hi> Iſa. 9 6. Beloved, as there are certain ſpecial times, wherein God will let us ſee our need of him for other things; he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us ſometimes into ſickneſs, that we may cry to him, who is the God of our health and ſalvation; he brings us into poverty, that we may acknowledge him to be the God of our Plenty; he brings us into thraldome, that we may ſee in how much need we ſtand of him for our liberty; he brings us into great dangers, that we may ſee how much need we ſtand of his Power for our protection and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: So he brings us ſometimes into the dark, or into ſome inextricable wilderneſs, that we may ſee how much we ſtand in need of his Wiſdom for our direction. As God doth many times <hi>Non-plus</hi> the Power of the creature: So he doth <hi>Non-plus</hi> the wiſdom of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it may live by Faith in him for direction and counſel. As the Mother leaveth the childe in the dark, or ſteps aſide at a croſs way, that the childe may cry after her, and acknowledge its beholdingneſs to her for guidance and direction: So deals God with his children in dark and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult times.

How doth it concern us, at ſuch times as theſe to improve our Faith in God by Prayer, grounded upon his Promiſes for our direction? A believer acting his Faith, hath great advantage of an unbeliever; an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is froward and paſſionate, and heady and haſty, when he is put to plunge, he waits not for the <hi>Counſel of God,</hi> Pſal. 106.13.

Never did the <hi>eye of a ſervant</hi> look with more intention <hi>to the hand of his Maſter,</hi> nor the <hi>eyes of a maiden to the hand of her Miſtris,</hi> obſerving every little caſt of their eye, every little beck of their finger, than the eyes of the faithful look to the hand and eye of God for their direction in difficult times: They look to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, for direction from the Word of God.<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.105.</note> This Word is <hi>a lamp unto their feet, and a light unto their paths;</hi> and if the Word be dark in any thing, they look to the Promiſe of the Spirit, for the right underſtanding of the word: Iſa. 30 21. <hi>Thine ears ſhall hear a word behinde thee, ſaying, This is the way, walk ye in it: when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</hi> Now this Promiſe is made good by Faith;<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.98.

O the preciouſneſs of Faith, that is able to procure the moſt precious things at the hand of God!

Num. 14.11. <hi>How long will it be ere this people believe me,</hi> (ſaith God) of the murmuring Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs? An unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart is evermore an unquiet, &amp; a diſcontented heart. He that doth not enjoy God by Faith, how is it poſſible he ſhould be ſatisfied with Creature-enjoyments, eſpecially in the midſt of Creature-diſcontents? Faith is that which <hi>ſweetens</hi> our very Natural Life; how much more then that which is <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Supernatural?</hi> Wouldſt thou be aſſured that Chriſt is thine? Faith in due time will give thee this aſſurance: for, <hi>Chriſt dwells in the heart by faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. Wouldſt thou be aſſured thou art a Childe of God, and maiſt come in for a Childs Portion? Faith will give thee this aſſurance alſo: Joh. 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, he gave power to be the Sons of God, even to as many as believe on his Name.</hi> Wouldſt thou receive more abundance of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus?

very meaning of the words, you may ſee by the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, cited by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 13. Firſt, he ſets down <hi>Gods blinding</hi> their eyes, and hardning their hearts, in the 14 <hi>Verſe;</hi> and then he ſets down the peoples <hi>wilful ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of their own eyes, and hardning of their own hearts, in the 15 <hi>Verſe,</hi> as the very cauſe of the former: for, ſaith he, <hi>This peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their eyes have they cloſed, &amp;c.</hi> Becauſe they wilfully cloſed their own eyes, and would not ſee ſo much as they might have ſeen by the improvement of the means, therefore God gave them up to further blindneſs; becauſe they wilfully hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their own hearts againſt Judgements and Mercies, therefore God gave them up to further hardneſs. 'Tis true indeed, we are all naturally blinde, and hard-hearted: but when unto this natural blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, we do adde an affected voluntary wilful blindneſs of mind, and hardneſs of heart: Then at the laſt, after the exerciſe of a great deal of patience and long-ſuffering (for 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, this very Prophet was Preaching to them, and proffering mercy upon their Repentance, above <hi>threeſcore</hi> years together) I ſay, at the laſt, after the abuſe of ſo many precious Means, Mercies, and Motions of his Holy Spirit; at laſt, when Gods patience is tired out, ſo that he can bear and forbear no longer (<hi>I am weary with repenting, ſaith God,</hi> Jer. 15.6. therefore at the laſt God gives up to <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial</hi> blindneſs of minde, and hardneſs of heart. Their affected, voluntary, and wilful blindneſs, is at the laſt (<hi>after ſo long a time,</hi> as the Author to the Hebrews ſpeaks) it is puniſhed with judicial blindneſs and hardneſs of heart: and this is the ſoreſt blindneſs on this ſide Hell, to be given up to this judicial blindneſs and unbelief. As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of his Viſion, Gen. 28.17. <hi>This is none other but the Houſe of God, and this is the gate of Heaven:</hi> So may we ſay on the other ſide, of this Judgement of the Prophets Viſion, This is none other, but the very <hi>houſe of the ſtrong man armed,</hi> and this is the <hi>gate of Hell.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. By conſidering the greatneſs of the <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> it is that which cauſeth God to hide his face, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the manifeſtation of his favour from his deareſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Pſal. 30.6, 7. <hi>And in my proſperity I ſaid, I ſhall never be removed; Lord, by thy favour thou haſt made my Mountain to ſtand ſtrong:</hi> But what follows? <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> O remember, Friends, how by truſting to the Mountain of any created ſtrength, either in Temporal or Spiritual things: we wrong God, we wrong our Selves, we weaken our Faith, and we cauſe God to withdraw his wonted influence.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond particular Impediment of Faith is this;<note place="margin">2.

Suppoſe God promiſe this or that, and we preſently conſulting with Fleſh and Blood, cry out, It is impoſſible, or at leaſt improbable, and ſo we'll never believe it. Thus it was with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> at the firſt, when Chriſt ſpake to him of a ſecond birth, Joh. 3. <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>How can a man be born, when he is old?

And thus it was with that incredulous Lord, when God foretold the plentiful relief of poor beſieged <hi>Samaria,</hi> within the compaſs of a day, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the Lord would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?</hi> 2 Kings 7.2. And thus when God promiſeth

deliverance to his People in their greateſt ſtraights, when there is no apparent or viſible means to be ſeen, when God promiſeth the Reſurrection of the body from the Grave, and many ſuch like things, I'll never believe it, ſaith a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man: Why ſo? It is altogether unlikely, it is above the reach of Reaſon, it is above the reach of all created ſtrength. And this is the ſecond particular Impediment of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Well, but how ſhall we remove it? how ſhall we rowl away this ſtone?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cure.</note>I anſwer, By conſidering the infinite <hi>diſproportion</hi> betwixt God and us? What if the thing promiſed be above the graſp of our wiſdom and ſtrength? is it therefore above the wiſdom and ſtrength of God? It is the ſillieſt thing in the world to meaſure God by our ſelves. Hear what the Lord ſaith, Zech. 8.6. <hi>If it be marvellous in your eyes, ſhould it be alſo marvellous in my eyes, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> Thoſe things that are <hi>impoſſible with men,</hi> are poſſible, yea, moſt <hi>facile</hi> and eaſie with God.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And therefore it is the proper work of Faith, to lay hold upon the <hi>Power</hi> of God, as well as upon the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God. If God doth but ſpeak a thing, Faith doubts not of the Power of God to make his Word good. When carnal reaſon ſaith, How is it poſſible? How can this be? Faith gets aloft upon the head of Reaſon, and ſeeth quite beyond it: when Reaſon can ſee no further, Faith ſaith, It is ſo, it is ſo, and claps the hands, as if it had the thing in preſent poſſeſſion: and ſo it is an <hi>evidence of things not ſeen</hi> by the eye of carnal Reaſon.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1. Rom. 4.19, 20, 21.</note> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> believeth againſt all common Reaſon that he ſhould have a Son, becauſe God had ſaid it, although he and his wife were as good as dead in the courſe of Nature.

                  <p>The third is the harboring of ſome <hi>beloved ſin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3. Harbouring ſome Luſt.</note> which we are loth to part with. For Faith, when it comes into the heart, will come as a purifying Faith, or elſe it will not come at all. Now if a man prefers the ſatisfying of his luſt, before the ſatisfying of his Faith, there's the ſtop, and there's the check in the work of Faith. Therefore ſaith Chriſt to thoſe that were carried away with the luſt of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, <hi>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God onely?</hi> Joh. 5.44.</p>
                  <p>Now to remove this Impediment,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and to rowl away this ſtone, Remember, all fleſhly luſts, though they flatter us, and make fair as if they were our <hi>intimate friends,</hi> yet are our <hi>deadly enemies,</hi> and under-hand they fight againſt us: <hi>Dearly beloved</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter) I beſeech you as pilgrims and ſtrangers, abſtain from fleſhly luſts,</hi>

And therefore ſuppoſe the luſt be never ſo dear, yet let thy Salvation be dearer: Suppoſe it be an adulterous eye, or ſuppoſe it be a deceitful hand, a hand that bringeth in ſo much profit by the year, and were it not for this, thou couldſt finde in thine heart to believe, and to become a Chriſtian in earneſt. O remember what this luſt muſt coſt thee, that juſtles out thy Faith; it will coſt thee the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life of thy immortal Soul: and therefore were it as dear to thee as thy <hi>right eye,</hi> or thy <hi>right hand,</hi> away with it, and <hi>caſt it from thee.</hi> Remember what Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 5.29, 30. <hi>It is better for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh, than that thy whole body ſhould be caſt into hell.</hi> And ſo much for the third particular Impediment, and the way to remove it.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That when ever Satan preſents a promiſe to the Soul, he preſents it in a <hi>Wreſted ſenſe;</hi> or he preſents it for a <hi>Wrong end,</hi> as Mat. 4.6. <hi>It's written, He ſhall keep thee, &amp;c.</hi> This promiſe is preſented in a <hi>Wreſted Senſe,</hi> ſo as the meaning of it could not ſtand with that other Scripture,

                     <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt, &amp;c.</hi> God doth promiſe to protect in ſuch dangers as his providence caſts us into, in the way of our calling, but not in ſuch dangers as our own folly and preſumption caſts us into, when we forſake our way. And therefore the Divel cunningly, and wickedly leaves out that part of the Word, <hi>In all thy wayes,</hi> Pſa. 91.11, 12.</p>

A ſtronger faith is required to live upon God without comfort, than when God ſhines in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Spirits with abundance of joy. Its nothing for the Childe to believe the Mother loveth it, whilſt ſhe ſets it upon the knee, kiſſeth it, and feeds it with ſweet meats; but to ſee the Mother love through the twigs of the Rod, and through all the clouds of her frownings and hidings, this argues no ſmall ſtrength of love, and of natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Childe. I know your thoughts out-run me in the Application, <hi>ſo that there may be ſtrong faith, where there is little comfort:</hi> Therefore let every man prove his faith, that he may not be to ſeek in the acting of it.

True faith in the ſaving knowledge of the Son of God, is as the very door and entrance into Gods Kingdom; but you muſt look to meet with oppoſition at the very threſhold. Mat. 23.13. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites, for ye ſhut up, &amp;c.</hi> The Lord grant none of us may be found amongſt the number of oppoſers, <hi>making ſad</hi> the hearts of thoſe God would <hi>not have made ſad,</hi> but rather be found helpers of one anothers faith: For all is little enough, in regard of the oppoſition we ſhall meet withall from without.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is <hi>no eaſie matter to believe:</hi> all things are eaſie to him that believeth, but it is no eaſie matter to believe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The exceeding greatneſs of Gods power is ſeen in all them that do believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20. No wonder ſo few believe; 'tis a Miracle of Mercy that there are ſo many.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He that would believe, muſt be reſolved to break through all Impediments;</hi> as <hi>Davids</hi> Worthies brake through the Hoſt of the Philiſtims: Armies of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are againſt us, yet be reſolute, <hi>If God be for us, who ſhall be againſt us?</hi> The beginnings of faith will

                     <note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> and tells him, <hi>'Tis hard for him to kick againſt the pricks.</hi> One of Chriſts arrows ſhot out from the mouth of the Miniſter, wounds him to the very heart, and he cannot be quiet, till the ſame hand that wounded him, do heal him again: <hi>I kill, and I give life; I wound, and make whole,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) which is as true of the Soul, as of the Body, Deut. 32.39. Now all this plainly ſheweth the work is wholly of God, and not of our ſelves, nor in the power of ſecond Means. But yet for all this, I ſay means are to be uſed, by way of Gods Ordinance, though the efficacy of the means depends
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:118867:280"/>
wholly upon God, and not upon our ſelves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very obſervable in that moſt <hi>miraculous</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Apoſtle in the 9th of the Acts, when God met him, and unhors'd him, and aſtoniſh'd him, and ſtrook him into a trembling Fit, and whilſt he was breathing out threatnings againſt the People of God, he ſo tam'd his proud ſpirit, that he is glad to ſay, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> yet I ſay, it is very obſervable, that however God <hi>begun</hi> the work of his Converſion by his own <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi> hand, yet he would not <hi>finiſh</hi> it without ſecond <hi>means,</hi> without the hand of an Inſtrument. And therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>What wilt thou have me to do, Lord?</hi> Chriſt doth not ſay, I would have thee do this or that, neither doth he reſtore his ſight to him for the preſent, but he bids him <hi>go to the City,</hi> and there <hi>Ananias</hi> muſt be an inſtrument under Jeſus Chriſt to <hi>reſtore his ſight,</hi> and to give him in <hi>charge</hi> what God would have him do. Much more then, in the <hi>ordinary way</hi> of Gods working, are we bound to the uſe of ſecond means, as ever we deſire the recovery of our Spiritual ſight, or the obtaining of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious grace of faith.</p>
                  <p>What are thoſe means then that we muſt uſe and attend upon?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Is the Word of God,<note place="margin">Means.</note> the Preaching of the Word? The Scripture is very clear in this.<note place="margin">1. Word of God.</note> Rom 10.14 <hi>How ſhall they believe on him of whom they have not heard?</hi> and ver. 17. <hi>So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Therefore as Faith is the Life of the Soul, under God; ſo the Word is the Life of Faith. As the Juſt lives by Faith, ſo Faith lives upon the Word. No Humane Teſtimony (though great reſpect and reverence is to be had to the Church, and Godly writers) yet I ſay, No humane Teſtimony can be the ground of Divine Faith. 'Tis true indeed, the Word cannot work Faith without the Spirit; I will not ſay, The Spirit cannot work Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Word: But this I ſay, That Ordinarily the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:118867:281"/>
doth not work Faith without the Word. Though the <hi>Spirit</hi> be not abſolutely bound to the uſe of Means, yet we are bound to the uſe of them, as ever we expect the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: <hi>Here will I meet with thee,</hi> ſaith the Spirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very obſervable, Where God makes a Promiſe of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> in the ſame place alſo he makes a Promiſe of the <hi>Word,</hi> to continue with his Church to the end of the World. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. laſt. <hi>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my Words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Word and the Spirit you ſee go hand in hand, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to expect the Spirit without the Word; neither are we to expect Fath, which is wrought by thy Spirit, unleſſe it be alſo wrought by the Word, as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan or Inſtrument of the Spirit. And hence alſo the Word of God is called <hi>the Word of Faith,</hi> Rom. 10.8. Becauſe Faith in grown perſons is wrought by the Word, and ſo the Word is both the Object, and the Inſtrument of Faith. It is <hi>Verbum quod creditur,</hi> and <hi>Verbum quô creditur,</hi> the Word <hi>that is believed,</hi> and the Word <hi>by which we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to believe</hi> this or that. And how ſhould we then with all care and conſcience attend upon the Miniſtery of the Word, as ever we deſire faith, as ever we deſire life. Would we live for ever, <hi>O hear,</hi> ſays God, <hi>and your ſoul ſhall live; and I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David,</hi> Iſa. 55.3. Mark that: <hi>Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live;</hi> no hearing, no life; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, no hearing, no faith: for, <hi>The juſt lives by his faith,</hi> and his faith lives by the Word. And therefore ſuch as live above Ordinances, and above the Word, I know not what to make of them; they are ſuch as live not by faith, but above faith: They muſt either be <hi>in Heaven, or nearer to Hell</hi> than they are aware; for all the true Members of
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:118867:281"/>
the Church upon earth do <hi>live by Faith,</hi> and that faith upon the Word. And therefore ſuch perſons as live above Ordinances in <hi>that</hi> ſenſe, ſo as to be content to live <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> them, are of a ſtrange temper. They are like ſuch conceited perſons who in a diſtemper of melancholly do think they can live without meat: and indeed as well may the body live its natural life without meat, as the Soul live its Spiritual and Supernatural life without the Word: Job 23.12. <hi>I have deſired the words of his mouth, mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e than my appointed food:</hi> the Word of God is the food of the Soul. Faith is both begotten and encreaſed by the Word, by every <hi>word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God doth man live,</hi> Mat. 4.4. The Word of God is like blood in the natural Body, <hi>Vehiculum Spiritûs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Word,<note place="margin">The Word the ordinary mean of Faith.</note> is the <hi>power of God to Salvation to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1.16. This is the main end of that great Ordinance of the Miniſtery which was given for the begetting and for the encreaſing faith, <hi>till we all come in the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.13. And therefore I ſay, attend upon this Ordinance: as ever thou deſireſt Faith, make uſe of theſe deſpicable <hi>Rams-horns,</hi> as ever thou deſireſt the mighty walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> ſhould fall down; for the <hi>weapons</hi> of the Miniſtery <hi>are mighty through God to the pulling down of all the ſtrong holds</hi> of ſin and Satan, all the Oppoſites and Impediments of Faith: Wait at the <hi>Pool of Betheſda,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 5.2, 5.</note> as ever thou deſireſt to be cured of thy Spiritual Maladies. A Miracle, yea a Million of Miracles will not beget faith in thee, if that Word do not beget it, which was at the firſt confirmed by Miracles. If ordinary and living Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers do thee no good, <hi>neither wouldſt thou believe,</hi> if an extraordinary and miraculous Meſſengers <hi>ſhould ariſe from the dead</hi> and preach to thee.<note place="margin">Luke 16.31.</note> Therefore ſuch as look for faith by Revelation, without and beyond the Word, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>this perſwaſion cometh not of him that calleth:</hi>

                  <p>Thus the Spirit convinceth by the Law, and that ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully and effectually, when God is pleaſed to ſet it home upon any particular ſoul, that he apprehends the Miniſter ſpeaks ſo, as if he knew his very heart, or ſo as if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpoke to none but him in all the Congregation.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Grace in the <hi>Inchoation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Humility in all the periods of grace.</note> not as if a man could be truly humble before he hath grace, but to intimate he hath no grace till he be humble: for, he that hath one grace, hath all graces; and therefore he that hath faith, hath alſo humility. The new man hath all his parts and members, ſo ſoon as ever there is a new birth in the Soul: He hath therefore humility as well as other graces. Yea poverty of Spirit is made the beginning of all grace. Mat 5.3. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi> Thus in the inchoation or beginning of grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the <hi>Augmentation</hi> or increaſe of grace. Jam. 4.6. <hi>But he giveth more grace, wherefore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</hi> He giveth more grace to the humble: As a Tree, the deeper it roots, the more it ſpreadeth in its branches, and increaſeth in its fruits: ſo the deeper the creature is rooted in humility, the more abundant it is in the fruits of Piety: the high Mountains are barren, when the lowly Valleys are very fruitful.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the <hi>Conſervation</hi> or eſtabliſhing of Grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ves to ſuch the grace of Perſeverance. Spiritual Pride will certainly have a fall; but he that ſtands low in his own apprehenſion, he ſtands ſure: <hi>When we are weak,</hi> that is, ſenſible of our own weakneſs, <hi>then are we ſtrong,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.10. Such are like to ſtand, when others are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and fall away.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God gives grace to the humble in the perfection of it, which is attained in glory. Therefore it is ſaid of the Heavenly Courtiers, Rev. 4.10, 11. <hi>The four and twenty
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:118867:285"/>
Elders fall down before him that ſate on the Throne, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their Crowns before the Throne, ſaying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive glory, and honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> Mark ye: as dejection in the bottom of the nethermoſt Pit cannot ſtrip the devil and wicked men of their Pride (for they wil blaſpheme the name of God) they may be <hi>humbled,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 16.11.</note> but they will not be truly <hi>humble</hi> to all Eternity: So on the other ſide, exaltation to the higheſt degree of glory, does no ways deveſt the Saints of God of their former humility. Nay, the more glorious, the more gracious, and therefore the more humble.</p>
                  <p>Thus God gives grace to the humble in the Inchoation, Augmentation, Conſervation, and Perfection. Therefore there is no Soul brought home to Chriſt, but muſt needs be humbled.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee Gods manner of working Faith by the Word, and why God doth uſually humble men more or leſs, and ſtir up in them ſtrong deſires after Chriſt before they come ſo fully and clearly to lay hold of the Promiſe, or at leaſt in their very <hi>firſt</hi> apprehenſion and laying hold of it. It is impoſſible to ſuppoſe Faith in a Soul that was never humbled.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I ſay, you ſee the ground of Gods method, and the matter of humiliation, as the fore-runner of Peace and Conſolation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall onely adde this, before I have done with the firſt Means of begetting Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Direction in applying the Promiſes.</note>If thou wouldſt believe, apply to thy ſelf in particular, what Promiſes God makes in general and indefinitely: As for Example, in the Scripture, when Chriſt ſaith, Joh. 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to thy ſelf. Therefore if I come to Chriſt by vertue of this Word, I am ſure he will not caſt me out.</p>
                  <pb n="527" facs="tcp:118867:285"/>
                  <p>So when the Scripture ſaith, Joh. 1.12. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name;</hi> to as many as receive him, he giveth the power or priviledge to become the Sons of God. Apply this to thy ſelf. Therefore ſince God hath made me willing to receive him (for my King and Saviour) I am ſure I have this priviledge,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.18.</note> to be the Son or Daughter of the Lord God Almighty.</p>
                  <p>So when the Scripture ſaith, in that notable Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt in the great day of the Feaſt, Joh. 7.37. <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink:</hi> Apply this to thy ſelf. Therefore ſince God hath given me grace to hunger and thirſt after the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. I am ſure I have as good warrant to take of the water of life as any other in the world: Rev. 22.17.—<hi>And let him that is a thirſt, come; and whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> Therefore ſaith the thirſty Soul, 'Tis as free for me, as for any other in the world. And thus is Faith begotten in the Soul, by a particular application of a general Promiſe. And ſo much for the firſt Means of begetting Faith, and that is the Word.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is Prayer:<note place="margin">Second Mean of begetting Faith by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> Pray that God would bleſs the Word, and all other Means: For the Word hath no Power to beget Faith of it ſelf, without the powerful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Spirit, by which the Word was breathed forth at the firſt. Neither have we power in our own will to make the Word effectual. Thoſe that talk ſo much of Free will, it is a ſhame then they believe no more, and do no more, if they had that freedom they boaſt of: but indeed, the very practice of ſuch men, is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute their Opinions. I'll never believe a man would be willing to lie in a naſty Dungeon all his life, if he had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and power to go out at his own pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>O be much in Prayer to God therefore, that he would ſet thy impriſoned Soul at liberty, that thou maiſt have power to believe. Thus did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 142.7. <hi>Bring
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:118867:286"/>
my ſoul out of priſon, that I may praiſe thy name, &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, O Lord, I confeſſe I am a poor priſoner to ſin and Satan, I would fain be ſet at liberty to believe thy Word and to do thy will but alas I cannot! I find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a door faſt ſhut upon me in this priſon, and many a lock upon the doors, many lets and impediments which I am never able to remove; and therefore gracious Lord, do that for me, which neither I my ſelf, nor all the friends I can make, are ever able to do for me; pay the debts of thy poor priſoner in my bleſſed ſurety, and ſet open the priſon doors, <hi>O bring my ſoul out of priſon,</hi> (O Lord) that I may praiſe thy name!</p>
                  <p>Thus ſhould we pray for Faith, as ever we deſire the Word ſhould be made effectual for our good.<note place="margin">Col. 4.3 1 Cor. 16.9</note> The Miniſters ſhould beg the prayers of the people (as <hi>Paul</hi> did (that he may have <hi>a door of utterance,</hi> and the people ſhould beg the prayers of the Miniſter, that they may have <hi>a door of entrance,</hi> that the immortal ſeed may be made an inſtrument of ſpiritual life, <hi>and the Juſt may live by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If ever we have Faith, if ever we be born again, the power of the Holy Ghoſt muſt <hi>overſhadow</hi> our ſouls,<note place="margin">John 3.18 Expounded.</note> and put life into the ſeed of the Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>are born not of bloods, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, Not of bloods:</hi> What's that? You know a man that comes of ſuch a parent, is ſaid to come of ſuch a <hi>blood.</hi> Now then put all the parents in the world together, and you ſhall find, grace runs not in any blood, they are not <hi>born of Bloods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Not of the Will of the fleſh:</hi> What's that? A fleſhly carnal man cannot convert himſelf, he cannot <hi>keep alive his own ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 22.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Not of the Will of man:</hi> What is that? Take a Regenerate man, the beſt man in the world, yet he hath not power to convert another unleſſe God be with him in

the work, and ſo the truth is clear, Gods people are born not of Bloods, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of man, but of God. Remember what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6 44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him.</hi> And therefore the Church prayes, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1 4. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> Plead thus with God, and ſay, Lord thou commandeſt to believe, but I find I am ſhut up under unbelief: O thou that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt me ſee my own weakneſſe and inab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h. Remember Preaching is the Firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prayer is the Second.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let not Preaching juſtle out Prayer, nor let Prayer ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle out Preaching; as ſome would have the Ordinances quarrel one with another, whereas all lend their hands, and their natural help to give a lift at Faith. It is not the Word without the Spirit can do it: Therefore do thou pray the Spirit may ſpeak to thy heart, while the Miniſter Preacheth to the ear. That is a remarkable paſſage, <hi>Act.</hi> 11 21. <hi>And the hand of the Lord was with them,</hi> (with the Preachers) <hi>and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</hi> Mark that, The hand of the Lord was with them: We may preach long enough before we convert one ſoul, if the hand of the Lord be not with us; <hi>till the bellows be burnt,</hi> Jer. 6.29.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as Miniſters ſhould ſpend time before-hand in praying, as well as in ſtudying: So ſhould people alſo in praying for the Miniſter, as well as in hearing of him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou goeſt to the Congregation, lift up thy heart to God in this or the like manner: Lord, let thy powerful hand go along with the Miniſter this day. O let thy hand go along with his tongue, that I may have grace to believe what he ſpeaks to my Soul in thy Name! whilſt he knocks at the door of my heart, let thy Spirit unlock it for me;
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:118867:287"/>
as the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> was unlocked, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. <hi>Whoſe heart the Lord opened,</hi> whilſt <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching to her. To conclude,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.2</note> Remember <hi>Faith is the gift of God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good reaſon that we ſhould pray God to give us Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Prayer of a Natural man.</note>It is <hi>Objected,</hi> We cannot pray without Faith, and therefore how can we pray for Faith before we have it? This is to put a natural man upon duty before he be come to Chriſt, and what fruit can we expect from this?</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1 God hath no where freed a natural man from his duty, though he hath loſt his power to perfom it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As we tell natural men their duty, ſo we are to let them know from whom they may have power to perform it, namely, from Chriſt, if they be willing to cloſe with him.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, It is true the prayers of ſuch as are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Jeſus Chriſt, may juſtly be abominable: But yet if we obſerve it, God gives ſome incouragement a loof off, that ſuch as are ſtrangers may not utterly be diſcouraged to cry to God for the bread of Life, for the Scripture tels us, an importunate ſuiter may be heard, though

                  <p n="2">2. Though God threatneth wicked men that are reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go on in their ſins, that he will ſtop his ears to their prayers; yet ſometimes when they are deeply humbled (though not wholly converted) God hath heard their prayers, that this his goodneſs might lead them to through repentance.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now though ſome ſuch fall away, yet others in the uſe of Means come at laſt to be fully converted, and Prayer is one Means among the reſt. Look upon <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> 2 Chro 33.12, &amp;c. <hi>When he was in affliction, he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was intreated of him, and heard his ſupplication.</hi> Look upon <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9.11. —<hi>behold he prayeth.</hi> Yet his Converſion was not wholly perfected, (though his conſcience was ſtirred, and he was much humbled) for as yet he was not inſtructed by <hi>Ananias,</hi> he had not received his ſight, (a pledge of the cure of his Spiritual blindneſs) he had not received the holy Ghoſt, (for that he received after the preaching of <hi>Ananias,</hi> ver. 17.)</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Let all men (as God ſhall aſſiſt) lift up their hearts to God in Prayer, that they may have grace to believe the Goſpel; for who knows, but that the Spirit of Supplication and Faith may be poured upon them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Zech. 12.10. <hi>I will pour upon the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,

and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the Spirit of Grace and of Supplications, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 19.3 —9. <hi>Zacheus</hi> his ſtrong deſires after Chriſt, were anſwered with grace. If they have ſtrong deſires, it argues there are the ſeeds of Faith, and therefore ſuch are encouraged to pray: Mat. 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Therefore pray that thou maiſt believe; and believe, that thou maiſt pray.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If thou canſt not pray thy ſelf, yet beg the prayers of others in thy behalf; as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> begg'd the prayers of the Apoſtles, apprehending their prayers to be more prevalent than his own. It is poſſible God may hear the prayers of <hi>Job</hi> for his friends,<note place="margin">Job 42.8, 9.</note> when he will not hear them for themſelves. However, pray thy ſelf, and be ſure to beg the prayers of others; that the new creature in thy Soul, may be as <hi>Samuel,</hi> which ſignifies,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 1.20.</note> One that is begg'd of God: That the prayers of thy faithful friends may be as the Spiritual Midwives of thy new Birth.</p>
                  <p>How did <hi>Paul</hi> travel in the Spiritual birth of others? ſometimes by Preaching, and ſometimes by Prayers; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by one means, and ſometimes by another: Gal. 4.19. <hi>My little children, of whom I travel in birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you.</hi>

                  <p>The Jaylors Converſion, Act. 16.25. is ſet down as the conſequent of the Apoſtles prayers; not onely their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of <hi>his</hi> Priſon, but his deliverance out of the <hi>Devils</hi> Priſon, is ſet down as a fruit of their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>Pray therefore thy ſelf, and beg the Prayers of others, that the heavy grave ſtones, and all thoſe other Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have ſpoken of, may be rolled out of the way, that thou maiſt have power to believe, and ſo power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Son of God by Faith.

that walketh with wiſe men ſhall be wiſe; but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is much power in Company to make a man either very bad, or very good. But beſide the <hi>Moral Efficacy</hi> of Vices and Vertues held out by way of Example, (for we are apt to conceive, as <hi>Labans</hi> ſheep, according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns that lie before us) I ſay, beſides the Moral Efficacy, there is much more <hi>power in the threatning,</hi> taking hold upon a wicked Company-keeper. If God ſay a wicked company ſhall be deſtroyed, it were deſperate preſumption to expect Salvation in ſuch a way: And there is much <hi>power in the Promiſe</hi> on the other ſide; If God ſay, a Companion of wiſe and faithful men ſhall be made wiſe and faithful himſelf, we may well expect a bleſſing in that way, when God once gives us a heart to deſire, and to delight in the company of ſuch perſons.</p>
                  <p>As for vain Companions, you muſt never look to get good by them; the more they warm you with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, the colder will your hearts be to Jeſus Chriſt, (as it was with <hi>Peter</hi> in the High-Prieſts Hall) their Reproaches, their Mocks, their rotten and corrupt Communication, is like cold water caſt upon ſmoak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Diligence implyes the uſe of all Means with <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance:</hi> We do not account him diligent that works but by fits and by ſtarts, and when he doth work, he will be ſure to pick and chuſe, to take that he likes and leave the reſt. Neither is that ſoul diligent in the uſe of the Means that takes up one ordinance and layes down another; or takes it up at one time, and layes it down at another, though God cals for it at both alike. He that wilfully contemns God in one thing contemns him in all. Therefore, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſeek God in the uſe of all Means, with Perſeverance;

                  <p>It was the ordinary practice of the Apoſtles, not only to beget many to the Faith, but when they had done, they went up and down to viſit thoſe places and perſons on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

And in the ſecond chapter, the ſeventh verſe, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwads them to be <hi>well rooted, and eſtabliſhed in the faith.</hi> A Metaphor taken from <hi>trees,</hi> that are planted with good and ſufficient roots. A tree (eſpecially at the firſt planting) had better want branches then roots, branches will never beget roots, but good roots wil ſoon beget branches. And therefore the Apoſtle perſwadeth them to be well rooted and eſtabliſhed in the faith; Both in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of faith, and in the <hi>Grace</hi> of faith. And what he holds forth to the people by way of precept, that he holds forth alſo in his own practice, 2 Tim. 4 7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith: Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day.</hi> Marke he doth not ſay, I am ſure of a Crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe becauſe I have <hi>received</hi> the faith, but becauſe I have <hi>kept the faith.</hi> For no man is crowned except he ſtrives lawfully, and no man ſtrives lawfully but he who keeps his faith to the end.</p>
                  <p>Be ſure therefore to keep it when thou haſt it: Will not an artificer keep his tools and inſtruments? Will not a Scholar keep his books? A Traveller his bils of direction?

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, Firſt, becauſe God works by means, and ſo he is pleaſed to keep his people ſound in the faith, by ſetting before their eyes the danger of Apoſtacy, Heb. 3.12. <hi>Take heed brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:118867:295"/>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Secondly, becauſe, however Gods people can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſe Faith totally and finally, yet they may loſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it, and the actins of it without a great deal of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; and therefore it will be our wiſdom, not onely to keep faith when we have it, but to keep it in its power and vigour, that it may not be like thoſe things that are not the better, but the worſe for keeping.</p>
                  <p>Therefore keep thy Faith, as thou art charged to keep thy heart,<note place="margin">Prov. 4.23.</note> with all diligence: Or as men keep their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards and Gardens, with good Fences about them: Or ſo as thou wouldſt keep thy dwelling-houſe, <hi>wind-tight and water-tight:</hi> Or ſo as thou wouldſt thy lodging-room, or the bed wherein thou ſleepeſt; nay, the bed wherein Chriſt and the Church ſleepeth, Cant. 3.7. <hi>Behold the bed which is Solomons, guarded with threeſcore vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men of Iſrael:</hi> Or ſo as thou wouldſt keep thy Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure under Lock and Key; for Faith is a precious Treaſure: Or ſo as thou wouldſt keep thy bodily health; 3 Joh. 2. <hi>Beloved, I wiſh above all things, that thou maiſt proſper, and be in health, even as thy ſoul prospereth:</hi> Or ſo as thou wouldſt keep the Apple of thine Eye from the leaſt mote or mite of offence: Or ſo as thou wouldſt keep thy very life; for Faith, under God, is the very life of the Soul. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 13.3.</note> that <hi>he that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life:</hi> we may as truly ſay, He that keepeth his Faith, keepeth his life: for, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other things a man may be careful to keep, and it may be they will prove of very little uſe when all is done. The time will certainly come, when thy beſt friends cannot help thee, thy Meat and Drink cannot nouriſh thee, Phyſicians can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure thee, thy large Poſſeſſions cannot comfort thee; yet even at ſuch a time as this, if thou canſt but lay hold of a Promiſe, thou maiſt live upon the Word which God hath ſpoken, when thou canſt not live upon thy Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, nor live upon thy Calling, nor live upon thy Friends,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:118867:295"/>
nor live upon the Creatures of Meat and Drink; yet even then maiſt thou live upon thy Faith: when the juſt man can live upon nothing elſe, he can ſtill live upon his Faith. Keep Faith therefore, for it is thy life: <hi>Now skin for skin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and all that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi> If one ſhould deliver a very precious thing into the hand of a Friend, with this or the like charge, Be ſure to keep this about you whereſoever you come, and nothing ſhall be able to hurt you, no ill ſavour or peſtilential air ſhall be able to infect you.</p>
                  <p>O how careful would a man be to keep ſuch a Receipt! he would keep it as his very life. And ſuch a Receipt,<note place="margin">Faith a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Charm.</note> ſuch a Spiritual Charm is Faith: he gives this ſolemn charge, Keep your Faith as you would keep your life; keep your Faith, and nothing ſhall be able to hurt you: Luk. 10.19. <hi>Behold, I give you power to tread on Serpents and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing ſhall by any means hurt you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this was true of the Faith of <hi>Miracles</hi> in thoſe days: ſo it is as true of <hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> in a ſound and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſenſe at this day. Such as keep their Faith in ſafety, ſhall keep themſelves in ſafety, and ſhall tread down Satan, that old Serpent, under their feet, and nothing ſhall be able to offend them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, where the Holy Ghoſt makes mention of the greateſt troubles that befel the Church, he makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo of their guard; <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 13.10. and 14.12. Keep thy Faith therefore, and thy Patience, as ever thou deſireſt to be kept in the great hour of Temptation: Rev. 3.10. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, I will alſo keep thee from the hour of Temptation, which ſhall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</hi> O remember, this will be the comfort,<note place="margin">It is the glory of a Chriſtian to be found in the faith.</note> and the glory of a Chriſtian, to be found in the Faith, when Chriſt comes to make a ſcrutiny either of death, or at the general Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

1 Pet. 1.7. <hi>That the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praiſe, and honour, and glory, at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is nothing to ſay, Such a man had Faith; or, Such a man once made a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Profeſſion of the Faith: but this is the glory of Chriſtians, to be found in the Faith when Chriſt comes to Judgement.

An Apple that is rotten at the Core, will ſoon be gone. <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> is the uſual <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of <hi>Hypocriſie:</hi> He that would deceive in his <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> is juſtly deceived of his <hi>Salvation.</hi> That's the reaſon the Apoſtle ſo often perſwades them to be <hi>ſound in the faith,</hi> Tit. 1.13. and 2 2. Let us build our Faith upon good ground, upon Gods Word; and ſo, let us build our hearts upon Faith, and not build Faith upon our own deceitful hearts: Prov. 28.26. <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart is a fool; but whoſo walketh wiſely, he ſhall be delivered.</hi> That is the firſt Rule, Be ſound in the Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. Trial of it.</note>Secondly, if thou wouldſt keep thy Faith, and be ſound in it, be ſure to <hi>bring it to the Teſtimony,</hi> and examine it to the bottom. How do we know things to be ſound or unſound, but upon their trial: Therefore be ſure to try thy Faith, if thou wouldſt have it laſting Faith. Some take it for granted, their Faith is good and ſound: whereas if they
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:118867:296"/>
ſhould but feel the Pulſe of it, they would finde it very ſick and weak. It is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1.41.</note> they went a days journey, ſuppoſing <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to have been in their company; but when they came to a through ſcrutiny, they perceived they had loſt him, and were fain to go back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to ſeek him. It is to be feared, many a profeſſed Chriſtian plods on many a days, and many a years jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſuppoſing Faith, and Chriſt by Faith to be in their company; when, if they would make a diligent ſearch, they ſhould finde themſelves at a loſs, and ſuch as had need go back again, and begin all their work afreſh: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a man had better begin twenty times, than be once miſtaken in a matter of that moment. Therefore be ſure to examine thy Faith at the firſt, as thou deſireſt to keep thy credit with God or Man. A wiſe Merchant, that would keep his credit and keep his eſtate, is often caſting up his Books of Accompts, but he is like to keep neither of the former, that is careleſs in the latter. Be thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this wiſe Merchant, if thou wouldſt keep thy Faith to the laſt, be ſure to make trial of it at the firſt. How it ought to be tried, I ſhall not now ſtand to ſhew you, but refer you to that which was ſaid in the particular Uſe to that purpoſe.</p>

A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note>Fourthly, he that would keep his Faith, muſt keep a <hi>good Conſcience</hi> in all things; and he keeps a good Conſcience, that walks up to his light: Faith loves to dwell in a ſweet lodging; 1 Tim. 3.9. <hi>Holding the myſtery of faith in a pure conſcience</hi> The Myſtery of Faith is kept in a pure conſcience, if once the chamber of Conſcience be <hi>ſluttiſh and naſty,</hi> farewel Faith. To be ſure, Faith and a good Conſcience come and go both together: He that makes ſhipwrack of the one, cannot long preſerve the other from ſinking; 1 Tim. 1.19. <hi>Holding faith and a good conſcience, which ſome having put away, concerning faith have made ſhipwrack.</hi> A good conſcience, as we told you, is available to the holding both the Doctrine of Faith, and the Grace of Faith. And though theſe words are primarily meant of the Doctrine of Faith, as we ſhewed you, when we ſpake of living by Faith the Life of <hi>Preſervation,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, in anſwer to the Arguments of the Papiſts from this place: yet the Argument is good by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> from this Scripture. If a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be ſo available for the keeping of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Faith; then much more for keeping the <hi>Grace</hi> of Faith: foraſmuch as an evil conſcience is more inconſiſtent with the <hi>Grace</hi> of Faith, than with the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Faith. For howſoever, an evil conſcience is a very ready way to bribe and corrupt a mans judgement: yet many for a time have taught ſound Doctrine, who have been very unſound in their practice. Mat. 23.3. <hi>All therefore that they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do; but do not ye after their works, for they ſay, and do not.</hi> But an habitual corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of conſcience and converſation, cannot ſtand with the ſoundneſs of the grace of Faith. Joh. 1.6. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lie, and do not the truth.</hi> And 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> Therefore, 1 Tim. 1.5. he couples the grace of Faith and a good Conſcience together: <hi>Now
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:118867:297"/>
the end of the Commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conſcience, and of faith unfeigned.</hi> Be ſure therefore to keep a good conſcience, as thou wouldſt keep thy faith.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if thou wouldſt keep thy Faith,<note place="margin">5. Right bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</note> 
                     <hi>build it not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on falſe Promiſes;</hi> that is, when thou makeſt a Promiſe to thy ſelf, over and above that Promiſe which God hath made in his Word. Many a man, when he firſt begins to make Profeſſion of the Faith, he promiſeth to himſelf a great deal of eaſe, and riches, and credit in the world; whereas he ſhould expect the contrary, a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Perſecution, and Poverty, and Diſgrace, &amp;c. Now when ſuch a mans <hi>End fails</hi> him, his Faith alſo will fail him, and he is aſhamed of the very Profeſſion of it. Such low and carnal ends, are juſt like the weights that hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Clock, ſo long as the weights move, the Clock moves, but when the weights are once at ground, the Clock ſtands ſtill: So 'tis with ſuch men, ſo long as their carnal ends move them in Religious ways, they are moved; but when once their ends fail, they ſtand ſtark ſtill, and will move no further. Therefore beware of falſe ends in the Profeſſion of the Faith. Promiſe to thy ſelf no more than God hath promiſed, leſt failing of thy expectation, thy faith fail thee alſo. He is a wiſe and ſure builder, that ſits down and counts the coſt at the firſt: but he is a fool, and his building like to come to nothing, that after he hath laid the foundation, repents him of his work, and ſaith, I never thought it would have coſt me half ſo much, Luk. 14.28.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, if thou wouldſt keep thy Faith,<note place="margin">6. Commit it to God.</note> 
                     <hi>commit it to Gods keeping;</hi> whatſoever we commit to his truſt, is put into a ſafe hand: 2 Tim. 1.12. <hi>For the which cauſe I alſo ſuffer theſe things: nevertheleſs, I am not aſhamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day.</hi> Therefore be ſure not onely to commit other

things to God by faith, but even thy faith it ſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that to his keeping, pray him to keep it for thee.

Now Chriſts Prayer is as good as a Promiſe,<note place="margin">Joh. 11.</note> for we know that his <hi>Father heard him always.</hi> Therefore ground thy Prayer upon his Prayer, and ſay, Lord, hear me in that Prayer which I have taken out of my Saviours own mouth: O let not my Faith fail! That which thou haſt committed to my truſt, Lord, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to re-commit to thy truſt (for I dare not truſt my ſelf) Therefore as <hi>David</hi> ſaith of his mouth, Pſal. 141.3. <hi>Set a watch (O Lord) before my mouth, and keep thou the door of my lips:</hi> So ſhould every true Believer pray in relation to his heart; Set a watch (O Lord) before my heart, and keep thou the door of my Faith. That as the Lord is the keeper of thy perſon, Pſal. 121.5. <hi>The Lord is thy keeper:</hi> So he may be the <hi>Lord-Keeper</hi> of thy faith alſo. And that is the ſixth Means, Look unto him by Prayer, who is the <hi>Author and Finiſher of thy faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2.</p>

Yea, but the Spirit is not onely free in the Nature of it, and in the Donation of it: But it is alſo free in the <hi>Effects and Operations of it,</hi> that is to ſay, It makes thoſe free that receive it: Joh. 8.36. <hi>If the Son ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi> And how doth he make men free, but by his Spirit? The Spirit of liberty is oppoſed to the Spirit of bondage: 2 Cor. 3.17.—<hi>and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</hi> And this Spirit is an eſtabliſhing Spirit.

which makes men weary of their lives, and yet extremely affraid to dye.</p>
                  <p>The Free Spirit of Chriſt, by degrees, doth ſet his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants at liberty from theſe fears.

Therefore pray God to eſtabliſh thee with his free Spirit.</p>
                  <p>We have given many Motives before, I ſhall add but this one, and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Motive to pray for the Free Spirit.</note>As the right uſe of Chriſtian liberty is a ſpecial means to preſerve Faith: So Faith alſo in the right uſe of it, is a ſpecial means to preſerve Chriſtian Liberty, (which was purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt) as one hand helps ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one leg ſupports another, ſo it is in this caſe, betwixt Faith and Chriſtian liberty;<note place="margin">Faith &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty ſupports each other.</note> they do mutually ſtrengthen and ſupport one another. There are certain graces that are <hi>Cuſtodes libertatis Chriſtianae.</hi> (The Lord give us the thing, as well as the name.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Faith an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to preſerve Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty in many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</note>Now Faith is one of theſe graces, and a principal one; loſe thy Faith, and loſe thy Liberty, keep thy Faith and keep thy Liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for Example:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as believe in Chriſt, are free from the Law of ſin and death. Rom. 8.2. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:118867:299"/>
of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of ſin and death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some indeed profeſſing the Faith, account it their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſin againſt God, and are never troubled for it. But they are men of <hi>corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth of Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.5. For the liberty that Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, is not to be free <hi>from his ſervice,</hi> (as in other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſſions of ſervants) but free <hi>to his ſervice:</hi> His ſervice is perfect liberty. He hath ſet us at liberty from other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, (from the ſervice of ſin and ſatan.) <hi>That we might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him all our daies,</hi> Luke 1.74. Now I ſay, He that keeps his Faith, keeps his Freedom; he that loſeth his Faith, loſeth his <hi>Charter,</hi> or at the leaſt the <hi>Evidence</hi> of his Charter for his Spiritual Freedom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He that is ſtrong in the Faith ſtands faſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the <hi>liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made him free,</hi> Gal. 6.1. But he that is weak in the Faith, is alſo weak in the uſe of his Chriſtian liberty. Rom. 14.1. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> viz. in the uſe of things indifferent: And ſo we may ſay of other parts of our Freedome from other bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the <hi>Bondage of Sin.</hi> The ſtronger is thy Faith, the weaker is thy Luſt; for Faith purifieth the heart. Acts 15.9. <hi>And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the bondage of <hi>Inordinate Fear:</hi> The more Faith, the leſs fear; and on the other ſide, the leſſe Faith, the more fear, Mat. 8.26. <hi>Why are ye fearful, O ye of little Faith?</hi> Keep thy Faith therefore, as thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to keep thy Chriſtian Liberty, which is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Freedom in the world.

                  <p>This is a ſure Rule, Gods <hi>outward actings</hi> for us, are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually proportionable to his <hi>inward actings</hi> upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: He firſt ſets our <hi>Faith</hi> on work, and then our Faith ſets his <hi>Hand</hi> on work for us.

if you are able to believe enough. Unbelief ſhuts the door, but faith acted and excited, is that which turns the key, and opens the door of all the good Treaſures of God, to be drawn out for our ſeaſonable ſupply. Could we but act faith, nothing could make us miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe we be afflicted and perſecuted, yet afflictions and perſecutions are ſo far from making us miſerable, that they are a ſpecial gift and love-tokens from God, when he is pleaſed to give faith in the firſt place: Phil. 1.29. <hi>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi>

                        <hi>Help.</hi> 2. Application of the Promiſes.</note> next to the clearing up of thy intereſt in Chriſt, and in the promiſes: Thou muſt give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence not only to <hi>acquaint</hi> thy ſelf with the promiſes, and rich Legacies of thy heavenly father, but thou muſt alſo endevour ſeaſonably to <hi>apply</hi> them to thy <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſions</hi> and conditions, as alſo to put the promiſes <hi>in ſuit by prayers,</hi> and ſo make uſe of them by faith, (in drawing out vertue from Chriſt) as a rich man makes uſe of his mony, or ſtock and ſtore when he improves it and imploys it for the ſupply of his particular wants, to feed him, to clothe him, &amp;c. What a ſhame and a vanity is it (as Solomon ſpeaks) for a man to have abundance of wealth, and yet not to have <hi>a heart to make uſe of it for</hi> the ſupply of his wants? And the like ſhame it is to a Chriſtian to have a ſtock of Faith and precious promiſes, and yet not to have a heart to make uſe of them for the ſupply of his daily wants. So that to live by Faith (then) is to act our Faith in the promiſe, and to go to them upon all occaſions, as a man goes to his treaſury for the ſupply of all his wants.</p>
                  <p>For faith is nothing elſe but a believing of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and a truſting to it, through Chriſt for ſupply in the time of need.</p>
                  <p>As for Example.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Art thou in doubt, or, doſt thou <hi>want wiſdom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Several caſes wherein Faith is to be exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> for the ordering of thy temporal, or ſpiritual affairs, then act thy faith in that promiſe?

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Suppoſe thou art in <hi>outward troubles,</hi> and ſeeſt no viſible means for thy eſcape, act thy faith in that promiſe, Job 5.19. He ſhall <hi>deliver thee in ſix troubles, yea in ſeven there ſhall no evil touch thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Art thou in <hi>inward trouble</hi> of ſpirit, for want of the light of Gods countenance, Live by faith in that
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:118867:303"/>
promiſe, Pſal. 85.8—. He will <hi>ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

He will <hi>turn again, he will have compaſſion</hi> upon <hi>us, he will ſubdue our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and thou <hi>wilt caſt all their ſins into the depths of the Sea.</hi> Or that 2 Cor. 9 8.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Art thou afraid of <hi>enemies,</hi> act thy faith in that promiſe, Iſa. 54. Laſt—. No weapon <hi>that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Art thou afraid of <hi>Satan,</hi> or any in league with him. Away with that fear, act thy ſaith in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Numb. 23.23. Surely, <hi>there is no inchantment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jacob, neither is there any divination againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Art thou afraid of the <hi>fury of the oppreſſion,</hi> act thy faith in that promiſe, Pſal. 9.9. The <hi>Lord will be a refuge for the oppreſſed, a refuge in times of trouble.</hi>

                  <p>Eighthly, Art thou afraid of <hi>want in thy eſtate.</hi> Act thy faith in that promiſe, Pſal. 34.10—. <hi>They that ſeek the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Art thou afraid of <hi>diſgrace</hi> upon thy name, act thy faith in that promiſe, Zeph. 3.20. <hi>I will make you a name, and a praiſe among all the people of the earth</hi>—ſaith the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Art thou afraid of <hi>bodily ſickneſs, or death,</hi> Act thy faith in ſuch promiſes, where God engageth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf either to prevent ſickneſs, or to ſupport thee under it, or to make death a paſſage to a better life.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Art thou afraid thy <hi>labours</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in thy calling will prove fruitleſs? Act thy faith in that promiſe, Pſal. 1.3. <hi>Whatſoevor he doth ſhall proſper.</hi> Which is ſtill to be underſtood with ſubordination to
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:118867:303"/>
Gods glory and our own ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Twelthly, Art thou afraid what may <hi>become of thy children,</hi> when thou art dead and gone, Truſt God with them, and act thy faith upon that promiſe, Pſal. 112.2—. <hi>The generation of the upright ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Art thou troubled to ſee the <hi>preſent differences</hi> among Gods people? Live by faith in that promiſe, Jer. 32.39. <hi>I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Art thou afraid of <hi>unprofitableneſs</hi> under Gods <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi> becauſe thou findeſt much backwardneſs to them, and much deadneſs under them, apply that promiſe, Iſa. 12.3. <hi>Ye ſhall with joy draw water out of the wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that, Iſa. 48.17. I am the <hi>Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the</hi> way that thou ſhouldſt go.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. If thou be afraid of the <hi>hardneſs of thy beart, and thy want of love to the Lord,</hi> act faith in that promiſe, Deut. 30.6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thine heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, that thou maiſt live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus might we inſtance in other caſes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes, but theſe may ſuffice to give light to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Let us thus carefully make uſe of the talent of our faith, in trading with God upon all occaſions that our one or two talents may <hi>gain</hi> more.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> God is the firſt fountain of all grace and comfort, the promiſes are as ſeveral ſpring-heads, our acting faith upon the promiſes, is like the conveiance of waters in pipes to the ſeveral rooms in a houſe for the beſt ſervice of the inhabitants. Let us therefore act our faith that we may live comfortably upon
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:118867:304"/>
the promiſes, thoſe heavenly wells of ſalvation. And if God anſwer not preſently, we muſt act our faith in tarrying the lords leaſure, <hi>if the viſion be for an appointed time, the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that is the laſt branch of the exhortation, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting our ſelves) if faith be ſo excellent a grace, even the very life of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Then.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as we ſhould labour to get it, and,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to keep it, when we have it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to live by it, and act it, as well as keep it.</p>
                  <p>Branch <hi>IV.</hi> Of Exhortation.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>fourthly,</hi> we <hi>ſhould labour to increaſe the ſtock of our faith.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">Increaſe of Faith.</note>Faith is ſuch an excellent grace we can never have too much of it. He that increaſeth his faith increaſeth his livelyhood: For the juſt ſhall live by his faith.</p>
                  <p>It was the high commendation of thoſe poor Chriſtians, Jam. 2.5. That however they were poor in other things, <hi>yet they were rich in faith.</hi> The Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are commended for this, that their faith was on the growing hand, their faith <hi>grew exceedingly,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.3. Paul gives the like commendable teſtimony of the Corinthians that they <hi>abounded in faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.7.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould I ſay more, this is recorded to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting praiſe of him that is ſtiled the father of the faithful, that he was <hi>ſtrong in the faith,</hi> Rom. 4.20.</p>
                  <p>Let us all labour therefore that profeſs the ſame faith to attain (as neer as we can) to the ſame growth, that we may be ſtrong in the faith, giving glory to God as he did.</p>

                  <p>Motives to increaſe in Faith.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there are <hi>degrees of faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Faith hath degrees.</note> and no man attains to the higheſt degree at the firſt; faith is like a <hi>grain of muſtard ſeed</hi> before it comes to be a goodly tree, and the faithful are firſt <hi>babes</hi> in Chriſt, then <hi>young</hi> men, then <hi>ſtrong</hi> men, 1 Joh. 2.12, 13, 14. The Diſciples are oft reproved for their <hi>little faith,</hi> and the good woman is commended for her <hi>great faith.</hi> Mat. 15.28. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto her, O woman great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt, it ſeems there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is little faith, and there is great faith; there is weak faith, and there is ſtrong faith, and yet he that is ſtronger may grow ſtill: Paul was a ſtrong and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant champion in the faith (no whit <hi>inferiour</hi> to the very <hi>chief</hi> of the Apoſtles) and yet he ſpeaks of himſelf as if he had little or nothing in compariſon of that which he deſired and endeavoured after,<note place="margin">Pſal. 3.9.</note> in the <hi>third</hi> to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians he tells us, that he <hi>counts all things loſs and dung that he may know Chriſt, and the power of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> Why? Did he not know him already, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him already? doubtleſs, he did, but in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what was to come, and what he aimed at, he accounted that which he had already, but very little. And therefore ſays he in the very next words, <hi>Not as though I had already attained, or were already perfect, but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that, for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And therefore ſtill he deſireth to know more, and to believe more, he never thought he had faith enough. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if ſuch a <hi>ſtrong</hi> man in the faith as Paul was, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſtill to be upon the growing hand, how much more ſhould ſuch as are new <hi>beginners</hi> and but weak in the faith, deſire to grow from ſtrength to ſtrength accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:118867:305"/>
to that gracious promiſe. Job 17.9. <hi>The righteous ſhall hold on his way, and that hath clean</hi> hands <hi>ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> In other <hi>things</hi> men deſire to grow: In things <hi>natural,</hi> no child but deſires to grow till it be <hi>a man:</hi> In things <hi>artificial,</hi> no ſcholar, apprentice, but deſires to grow, till he become a <hi>perfect artiſt:</hi> In the things of the <hi>world,</hi> no man of mean eſtate, but deſires to grow, till he be rich, onely in grace men are content to be poor ſtill. Where we ſhould be covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, there we are well contented with a little. 1 Cor. 12.31. <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts.</hi> And where we ſhould be content, there we are covetous, as in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mot.</hi> 2. Growth of faith an evidence of its truth.</note>And this puts me in mind of a ſecond Motive to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our growth in faith. <hi>None have truth of faith but onely ſuch as deſire to grow in faith.</hi> and therefore when a profeſſor ſhall preſently grow ſecure, and ſay, So, now I believe, all is well, I have as much faith as will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry me to heaven, and what need I care for any more, it is a ſhrewd ſigne, ſuch a man hath no true faith at all, a painted child grows not; but a living child grows tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and taller from year to year. For in caſe a man had had truly taſted, how gratious the Lord is by the mouth of faith, he muſt needs ſay as they did of that bread and water of life: <hi>Lord evermore give us of this bread,</hi> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more give us of this water. A man thinks he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have enough of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> True faith is never content to ſtand at a ſtay: And the reaſon is becauſe it ſprings up of <hi>immortal ſeed,</hi> if the ſeed of faith could rot and die then it might ceaſe to grow,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> but becauſe the ſeed of it is immortal and incorruptible, therefore it muſt needs be up on the grownig hand. It may be nipt a little for a time like winter corn, but even then it grows in the <hi>root,</hi> and will grow the faſter for it, afterwards in the blade al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. What ſhall we ſay then of thoſe, that are alwayes ſtanding at a ſtay, that are <hi>children in the faith,</hi> for the
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:118867:305"/>
ſpace of fourty or fifty years together, theſe are <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> in the life of faith. It is confeſſed, every thing muſt have a beginning both in nature and grace, but it is a ſhame to be alwayes beginning, and never carrying on a work, to be a beginner from firſt to laſt is very ſtrange, and inconſiſtent with the grace of faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider the <hi>faſter our faith grows,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mot.</hi> 3. Faith makes all graces grow.</note> the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all other graces</hi> do grow, and the fruits of thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alſo in all manner of good works. It is a ſweet thing for a Chriſtian to be full of grace and full of good works. 2 Pet. 3.16. But <hi>grow in grace, and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—. As it is ſaid of <hi>Dorcas,</hi> Act. 9.36. This woman was <hi>full of good works,</hi> and <hi>alms deeds which ſhe did.</hi> But a man can <hi>never</hi> be <hi>full of theſe,</hi> unleſs he be <hi>full of faith,</hi> for faith is a <hi>radical</hi> grace, all graces and good works ſpring from faith as from a root, and are therefore called the <hi>fruits of faith. Chriſt is the maſter-root, but faith is a ſubſervient root.</hi> Now you know, the faſter the root grows, the faſter the branches grow and the fruits alſo.</p>
                  <p>So the faſter our faith grows, the faſter our love, our patience, our zeal for God and all other graces grow, and the faſter our good works alſo do grow and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply all good works (if good works indeed) do ſpring from faith. In vain do Chriſtians heap up <hi>precepts</hi> for a holy life, if in the mean time they neglect their <hi>faith,</hi> which draws power from Chriſt, which inables them to walk with God in the performance of thoſe good works, for <hi>without me ſaith</hi> Chriſt, ye <hi>can do nothing.</hi> Joh. 5.5.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, conſider, as more faith, more grace,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mot.</hi> 4. More Faith more Peace.</note> ſo the <hi>more faith the more peace,</hi> in <hi>ordinary</hi> courſe of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith we have peace with God through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So the ſtronger is our faith, the ſtronger our joy and conſolation,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:118867:306"/>
therefore the Apoſtles joyns both together. Rom. 15.13. Now the God of hope fill <hi>you with all joy and peace in believing,</hi> fulneſs of faith brings fulneſs of joy and peace. And the reaſon is, becauſe faith is the bond of union that knits Chriſt and the ſoul together: Now the ſtronger and neerer <hi>our union</hi> is unto Chriſt, the ſweeter and fuller is <hi>our communion</hi> with Chriſt. It is true, a weak faith may be ſufficient to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but it is not ſufficient (in all caſes) to <hi>conſolation.</hi> A weak believer crawls to heaven with much adoe, but a ſtrong believer runs his race to heaven with much joy, even in the midſt of afflictions and perſecution. Such a one hath an humble boldneſs at the throne of grace in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. And as he prays with <hi>more confidence,</hi> ſo he can wait with <hi>more patience,</hi> till God is pleaſed to anſwer his prayer. Therefore get good ſtore of faith as thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt good ſtore of peace and joy.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, conſider, we ſhould labour for much faith, becauſe <hi>the troubles of believers are many,</hi> and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies are many, that fiſh for them in thoſe troubled waters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mot.</hi> 5. Troubles of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note>Firſt, there <hi>troubles</hi> are many, Pſal. 34.19: <hi>Many are the troubles of the righteous:</hi> ſometimes outward troubles, and ſometimes inward troubles, they are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without ſome or other: And ſometimes they are <hi>more then the hairs of their head,</hi> as David ſpeaks. Pſal. 40.12.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, their <hi>enemies are many,</hi> that fiſh for them in theſe troubled waters, and as they are many, fo they are <hi>ſtrong:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Corruptions are ſtrong, and the Devil is ſtrong, he is called, the <hi>ſtrong man armed;</hi> And the world is a ſtrong enemie. Now how ſhall a weak faith ſtand up againſt ſo many ſtrong enemies, and againſt ſo many ſtout temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Therefore, Epheſians 6.10, 16. we are bidden, <hi>be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the poor of his
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:118867:306"/>
might: And above all, taking the ſhield of faith, which is needful to quench the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Beſides, theſe enemies put forth their ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us when we are at the <hi>weakeſt,</hi> they come upon us (as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> upon the Shechemties) when we are <hi>ſore,</hi> oppreſt with ſore and heavy troubles;<note place="margin">Gen 34.25.</note> Then <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> are moſt impetuous and violent, then they tempt us to inordinate care, fear ſorrow, and ſometimes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, or to fretting and murmuring againſt the Lord: Then Satan tempts ſtrongly to caſt off God, and his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>It was the Devil that ſpoke in <hi>Jobs</hi> wife (for, all that <hi>Job</hi> had, was delivered into <hi>his</hi> hand, Chap. 1.12.) when ſhe ſaid, <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thine integrity? Curſe God and die.</hi> Then the World ſtrikes in with a word of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: It will ſmile upon thee, it may be, in a time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, [<hi>Riches</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) gather many friends; yea, but the poor is ſeparated from his Neighbour</hi>] It will frown in time of adverſity. Now, I ſay, how ſhall a man be able to ſtand up with a weak faith in the midſt of ſo many troubles and enemies. Who mould venture into a rough and a boiſterous Sea, in a weak and ſlender Veſſel? In ſtrong Temptations, a weak faith is ready to betray us to inordinate fears. Mat. 8.26. <hi>Jeſus ſaid to the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</hi> Plainly intimating, That the greatneſs of their fears did ſpring not ſo much from the greatneſs of their troubles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as from the weakneſs of their faith. And therefore becauſe we know not what troubles or oppoſitions we may meet withall before we come to die, or at leaſt <hi>in that hour.</hi> It is good wiſdom to lay up ſtore of faith before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand: Time may ſoon come we may need all we have, and it may be, deſire we had more; however, <hi>ſtore is no ſore,</hi> eſpecially in things of this nature.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that, as the night of your troubles may come ſooner than you look for, (it is poſſible your Sun may ſet

                  <p>Suppoſe a man were to go a great and difficult way in a very dark night, and had but a little piece of a candles-end to direct him over narrow Bridges and dangerous Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, where the leaſt errour might coſt him his life, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable would his condition be, when that little piece of candle was burnt out: So it is in this caſe; therefore be ſure to get good ſtore of faith, and good ſtore of <hi>oyl</hi> in your <hi>Lamps.</hi> As you deſire to be found amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Wiſe Virgins, when the Bridegroom cometh.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe Conſiderations ſhould perſwade us to increaſe and grow ſtrong in the faith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how ſhould I know whether I do increaſe or decreaſe? whether my faith be ſtrong or weak?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appears to be weak,<note place="margin">Signs of a weak faith.</note> by the frequency of doubtings and fears; therefore little faith,<note place="margin">1. Frequency of doubtings.</note> and much fear or doubting, are uſually joyned together in Scripture, as S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of Love, 1 Joh. 3.18. <hi>Perfect love caſteth out fear; he that feareth, is not made perfect in love:</hi> So we may ſay of Faith, Perfect faith caſteth out fear; he that feareth, is not perfect in faith. It is true, there is none ſo perfect upon earth, but he may fear ſometimes: But yet this holds true, The more faith, the leſs fear; and the more fear, the leſs faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.

                     <note place="margin">3. Carefulneſs in worldly things.</note>Thirdly, weak faith is diſcovered by a mans <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary care about worldly things.</hi> He that hath ſtrong faith, will truſt God for the things of <hi>this</hi> life, as well as of that which is to come;<note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> his <hi>converſation is without covetouſneſs,</hi> and he is well content with ſuch things <hi>as he hath,</hi> becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee:</hi> So that he can boldly ſay, <hi>The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what fleſh can do unto me,</hi> Heb. 13.5.</p>
                  <p>But a man of a weak faith, as his heart is more full of worldly fears and cares: ſo his mouth is more full of diſtruſtful (or at leaſt, doubtful) expreſſions: <hi>What ſhall we eat?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>what ſhall we drink?</hi> and, <hi>what ſhall we put on?</hi> all which do ſpring either from want of faith, or at leaſt from the weakneſs of it: As Chriſt ſays, Mat. 6.30. <hi>Wherefore if God ſo clothe the graſs of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is caſt into the oven; ſhall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</hi> Plainly intimating, the reaſon why they had ſo much worldlineſs in their hearts, was, Becauſe they had ſo little faith there. Faith and the World are Combatants. 1 Joh. 5.4.—<hi>This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.</hi> Therefore when Faith gets above the World, it argues Faith is ſtrong; but when the World gets above Faith, it argues, Faith is weak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. Backwardneſs to holy duties, and remiſſneſs in them.</note>Fourthly, a weak faith is diſcovered by a mans <hi>back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to holy duties</hi> beforehand, and by his <hi>remiſſneſs in them</hi> afterwards. The Watch ſtands ſtill, when the Spring is down; and it moves but ſlowly, when the Spring is weak. Now faith is (as it were) the Spring of the Soul, it ſets all a work in Prayer, in Hearing, in Practice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the Spring of faith is weak, the Soul moves weakly and ſlowly, toward and in thoſe holy duties; but where the Spring grows ſtronger and ſtronger, it moves more ſtrongly and vigorouſly from day to day: <hi>I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> We having the ſame Spirit of faith, we alſo believe, and therefore we
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:118867:308"/>
have ſpoken, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 4.13. Strong Faith is like ſtrong wine, it muſt have a vent in gracious ſpeeches, and holy actions, Job. 32.18. <hi>For I am full of matter, the Spirit within me conſtraineth me; Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent, it is ready to burſt like new bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. I will ſpeak that I may be refreſhed, I will open my lips and anſwer.</hi> Look as ſtrength of love to Jeſus Chriſt conſtrains to holy duties, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. (<hi>For faith works by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6.) So the more faith, the more work the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth for God; the leſs faith, the leſs work. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take it with this Caution, that the work ſprings from a principle of <hi>Love</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe he that hath leſſe faith (or no faith at all) may yet, do more work <hi>ſeemingly</hi> for God, more <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> work, ſpringing from a principle of <hi>Self-love,</hi> and <hi>Self-ſeeking</hi> in praiſe or profit. But ſuch a man carries not his work before him, he doth it but to the halves; he ſerves God with bodily exerciſe, but he ſerves him not in Spirit and truth.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Sign, Yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> A weak Faith is diſcovered by a mans <hi>eaſie yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the temptations of ſin:</hi> A weak ſouldier is ſoon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, but a valiant champion ſtands it out ſtoutly, and bears many a blow before he yields. Therefore a weak faith is ſoon overcome by any little temptation of profit or pleaſure, and the like; whereas a ſtrong faith ſtands out manfully as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, who by Faith refuſed to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin, <hi>Chuſing rather to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God,</hi> Heb. 11.25. So alſo by yielding under tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of tryal, Joh. 6.6. And this he ſaid to <hi>prove him;</hi> viz. Philip in the miracle of multiplying the loaves, <hi>for he himſelf knew what he would do.</hi> As alſo the reſt of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the tempeſt at ſea. Conſider <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22.. And the woman of Canaan, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28. Both were patterns of ſtrong faith in two very eminent tryals.</p>
                  <p>By theſe therefore and the like rules we may examine
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:118867:309"/>
our faith, whether it be upon the growing, or decaying hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſome will ſay, Suppoſe my faith be weak and feeble, what means ſhould I uſe, that I may increaſe it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Means for the increaſe of Faith.</note>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt is, by an <hi>aſſiduous and diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Word of God:</hi> which in general is called the <hi>word of Faith;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Attendance on the Word.</note> not onely becauſe it <hi>begets</hi> faith at firſt, but becauſe it doth <hi>nouriſh</hi> it afterwards, till a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever comes to his full growth. <hi>Ex eiſdem nutrimur, ex quibus conſtamus:</hi> We are nouriſhed by the ſame means by which we are begotten at the firſt. The Word is the immortal ſeed, to beget our faith. 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever:</hi> And the Word is the heavenly Milk to nouriſh it, 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>As new born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> It is obſerved, <hi>Thomas</hi> was but once abſent, and he loſt much of the confirmation of his faith, Joh. 20.24, 25. Remember the charge, 2 Tim. 4.2. <hi>Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and doctrine:</hi> And the Promiſe, Prov. 8.34, 35. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors: For who ſo findeth me, findeth life, and ſhall obtain favour of the Lord.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle profeſſeth, what great deſire he had to ſee the Theſſalonians, and to preach to them, to that end, that <hi>he might perfect that which was lacking in their faith,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.10. And it was his laſt farewel to the Epheſians, when he told them they ſhould ſee his face no more, Acts 20.32. <hi>And now brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Look as by the preaching of the Word of God, I laid the firſt <hi>foundation</hi> of Faith amongſt you; ſo
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:118867:309"/>
now I commend you in my prayers to the ſame God, and to the guidance of the ſame Word, which God, and which Word, or which God by his Word, is able to build you up in the Faith, till you come to your journeys end, even till you come to enter upon the poſſeſſion of your heavenly inheritance, among all them that are ſanctified. And this is the firſt Means.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, is, the <hi>Promiſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Promiſes of the increaſe of faith</note> an eſpecial part of the Word: for, Faith lives by the Promiſe, as the juſt man lives by Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Some ſay, Where have you any Promiſe that Gods People ſhall believe? Or if they do believe, where is any Promiſe that they ſhall <hi>grow</hi> and increaſe in the Faith?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> To ſatisfie theſe men, they may look upon both, in <hi>one</hi> Promiſe: Rom. 1.17. <hi>For therein is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The juſt ſhall live by his faith.</hi> The Apoſtle in theſe words affirms two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Gods People are made righteouſneſs in the ſight of God, not by any inherent righteouſneſs of their own; but by the righteouſneſs of God <hi>ſupernaturally</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Word and Spirit of God, and applied by Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He affirms, That this Faith is ever upon the growing hand: And ſo God will ſhew himſelf righteous in making good his Promiſe for the <hi>increaſe</hi> of faith. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God is revealed <hi>from faith to faith;</hi> that is, in <hi>cauſing</hi> Gods People to grow from one degree of faith to another.</p>
                  <p>The like phraſe is uſed, Pſal. 84.7. <hi>They all go from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> that is; from one degree of ſtrength to another. So 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi> that is, from one degree of glory to another.</p>
                  <pb n="576" facs="tcp:118867:310"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note>God is <hi>righteous</hi> in cauſing his People to grow in faith, according to his Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that by faith we are firſt grafted and planted into Chriſt, as the Goſpel ſpeaks. And it is <hi>as</hi> true, that the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>They that are once planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall grow and flouriſh in the Courts of our God,</hi> Pſal. 92.13, 14. And why ſo? what is the Reaſon of this growth in Faith and Grace? It follows in the very next words, ver. 15. <hi>To ſhew that the Lord is upright, and that there is no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very ſame, in effect, with that expreſſion of <hi>Paul, The righteouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> and therefore the next way to increaſe faith, is to act faith, in theſe and the like Promiſes, which God hath purpoſely made for the increaſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The third Means is the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> eſpecially the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper. This is the Sacrament of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation: for the Word begets Faith, and the Sacrament is the Seal of the Word, and the Seal of the Covenant, or the <hi>viſible Word;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> and ſo it confirms Faith.</p>
                  <p>Men do not uſe to ſet a Seal to a Writing or to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, before the Parties be agreed, or to make them agree, but to ſtand as a ſure Teſtimony of their former agreement or ſtipulation each to other, and that they may the better truſt one another for the real performance of the Covenant on both ſides: So God doth not ordain this Seal to be ſet to a blank, before there be any Covenant made (for what is that, but to mock God, and to tell a real lie to ſeal to a Covenant, when there is no ſuch matter betwixt God and the Soul?) but God ordained it to confirm our Faith in the Covenant <hi>already</hi> made.</p>
                  <p>And we may ſay of Gods Seal, what the Scriptures ſpeak of Gods Oath, it is <hi>for Confirmation,</hi> Heb. 6.18, 19. Wouldſt thou have thy Faith confirmed and ſtrengthned? O come in faith! If God ordain <hi>Rams-horns</hi> for the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> Joſh. 6.5. <hi>Lamps</hi> for the

overthrow of the Midianites, Judg. 7.20. <hi>Jordan</hi> for the curing of <hi>Naamans</hi> Leproſie, 2 King. 5.10. <hi>Pulſe</hi> for the nouriſhing of the three young men, Dan. 1.12. Theſe means ſhall be effectual; and ſo ſhall the Sacrament: Onely <hi>let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Examine? you'll ſay: What ſhould he examine?<note place="margin">Examine two things in order to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Let him examine his <hi>Meat,</hi> and let him examine his <hi>Mouth</hi> and his Stomack.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let him examine his <hi>Meat,</hi> whether he can ſee and <hi>diſcern the Lords, body</hi> under thoſe Elements, or no: for he that doth not ſo,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> ſtands <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> in profaning that holy Ordinance, which is a Seal of the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let him examine his <hi>Mouth</hi> and his Stomack, Joh. 6 53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> The beſt meat in the world can do no good, where the creature hath neither Mouth nor ſtomack to feed upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now what is this <hi>Mouth,</hi> but Faiths believing in Chriſt, and feeding upon Chriſt, are both one (as he oft explains himſelf in the ſame Chapter) Therefore let a man exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Mouth and his Stomack, as well as his Meat, 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not that this excludes the Miniſter, who is bound to know the ſtate of his Flock.</p>
                  <p>If this be good at all times, ſurely it is beſt of all at the Sacrament, where the Apoſtle calls for examination in a ſpecial manner: Let him examine his Mouth as well as his Meat. We do not uſe to put meat into a dead mans mouth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Councel of Carthage</hi> condemned it as an abuſe of the Sacrament, to give it to a <hi>dead Body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sacrament not to be given to dead-hearted unbelievers.</note> becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Take,</hi> and <hi>Eat;</hi> but a dead Body can neither take nor eat. The ſame reaſon reacheth to an Unbeliever (if
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:118867:311"/>
we could as eaſily diſcern the one as the other) who is yet dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and therefore hath neither the Mouth of Faith, nor a Spiritual Stomack to feed upon Chriſt; but where God of his mercy hath given both, this breſt of the Church is of ſingular uſe to nutſe up her children,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18.</note> and to make them <hi>grow in grace, and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For God hath appointed no Ordinance in vain. The greater ſurely is the want of this <hi>Breſt</hi> in theſe days, and the cauſe of ſo much <hi>leanneſs</hi> amongſt Gods own Children in moſt places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Complaint of the interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the corruption of it as the cauſe.</note>I know not whether I ſhould complain more of the <hi>Nurſes</hi> or of the <hi>Children,</hi> or whether it were not better to turn our <hi>Complaints</hi> into <hi>Compaſſions,</hi> and both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and compaſſions into <hi>Prayers,</hi> that God would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect both Miniſters and People to ſeek him in due order, and to reſtore that Ordinance in a better manner than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; that he may not make any farther breach upon us; that children may not faſt ſo long, till they loſe their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks for want of ſucking, and Nurſes may not diſuſe and withhold the Breſt ſo long, till it be dried quite up for want of drawing. And this is the third Means which God hath appointed for the increaſe of Faith, The Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4. Prayer.</note>The fourth is <hi>Prayer:</hi> for this puts the Promiſes in ſuit, and ſanctifies both the Word and the Seal of the Word for the increaſe of Faith.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures tell us, That God is both the <hi>Author and the Finiſher of our Faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. If he be the Author, we are bound to pray to him for the <hi>beginnings</hi> of Faith (as in any poor meaſure we are able) but if he be the Finiſher of our Faith, we are much more bound to pray for the <hi>increaſing</hi> of it afterwards, becauſe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements and abilities are far greater. For 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a man ſhould pray in Faith for the obtaining of Faith, before he hath it: but he may pray in faith for the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of faith, when once he hath received a beginning of it.</p>
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:118867:311"/>
                  <p>If therefore a Natural man be bound to pray for Faith before he hath it, (though he be very unable to pray as he ought to pray) how much more is a Spiritual man bound to pray for increaſe of Faith, when he hath already <hi>taſted how gracious the Lord is,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.3.</note> in beſtowing that grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and hath in ſome meaſure received the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, whereby he is inabled to go to God for the ſupply of all his wants?</p>
                  <p>The man that to his own apprehenſion had but a little Faith, and much Unbelief, cries out with tears, <hi>Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: help mine unbelief,</hi> Mar. 9.24. Yea, the Diſciples themſelves had not ſo much Faith, but ſtill finding the want of more, they put up this great Requeſt to the Lord, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our faith,</hi> Luk. 17.5. and if ſuch as they had need, much more have we to pray to God for the increaſe of Faith.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Mean,<note place="margin">5. Chriſtian communion.</note> is <hi>Chriſtian Communion of Gods people one with another.</hi> This is a ſingular Mean to ſtrengthen Faith; the very ſight of the Brethren doth embolden and encourage in the Faith, Act. 28.15. How much more the mutual Inſtruction and Exhortation one of another? Job 4.3, 4. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſays thus to <hi>Job, Behold, thou haſt inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many, and thou haſt ſtrengthned the weak hands: Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou haſt ſtrengthned the feeble knees.</hi> You ſee, Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is a Mean to ſtrengthen in the Faith.</p>
                  <p>God in his Wiſdom communicates ſpecial ſtrength di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly to divers Members of the Body of Chriſt, to ſome more, to ſome leſs; to that end that the <hi>ſtrong</hi> may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>weak,</hi> and comfort the <hi>feeble-minded.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.14. 1 Cor. 14.26.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let all things be done to edification;</hi> that is, to the building up of one another in the Faith. And this is to be aimed at, not onely in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, but in private converſe of Chriſtians one with another, 1 Theſſ. 5.11. <hi>Wherefore comfort your ſelves together, and exhort one another, and edifie one another, even
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:118867:312"/>
as alſo ye do.</hi> Stones of the ſame building, do uphold and ſtrengthen one another; and ſo ſhould living and Spiritual ſtones in the <hi>holy Temple</hi> of the Church. This is a ſpecial and powerful means to ſtrengthen in the Faith. In this reſpect <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> are called <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-helpers</hi> of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.3.</note> becauſe they confirmed the Faith in thoſe in whom the Apoſtle had formerly planted it, by the preaching of the Goſpel, Rom. 16.3. And thus all of us ſhould be helpers one of anothers faith, and one of anothers joy: And indeed it is the main end, why God doth convert us at the firſt, and why he doth help us up again when we are fallen, that we may convert others, and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> them alſo in the Faith when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Luke 22.32. <hi>Thou being converted</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter) ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> And this is the fifth Means of growth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">6. Love to God.</note>The ſixth Means, is, to prove our <hi>Love</hi> to God: for this will prove his Love to us. 1 Joh. 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us;</hi> and the aſſurance of Gods love towards us, will marvellouſly ſtrengthen our faith towards God. Therefore our faith in him, and the manifeſtation of his love to us, are coupled together: Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, which hath loved me, and given himſelf for me.</hi> Now what better way is there to manifeſt Gods love to us, than by the manifeſtation of our love to him; for our love to him, is no other than a reflexion of his love to us.</p>
                  <p>Labour therefore to prove thy love to God, that if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ask thee the ſame queſtion he asked <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 21.15. <hi>Loveſt thou me?</hi> thou maiſt anſwer as he did, <hi>Yea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> And if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould anſwer again, How doſt thou prove the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of thy love? Thou maiſt anſwer again, Lord, I prove it by my <hi>love</hi> to thy <hi>ſheep,</hi> and by my <hi>love</hi> to thy <hi>lambs;</hi> though I cannot feed them in every reſpect as <hi>Peter</hi> did, yet I deſire to feed them as I am able: I do
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:118867:312"/>
not love them for my own ends, becauſe I would feed upon them, and clothe my ſelf with their fleece, but that I may clothe them and feed them as their neceſſities do require. And this is that which in the judgement of Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (publiſh'd in the face of al the world in the laſt day) doth publiſh the ſincerity of our love to him: Mat. 25.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as ye have done it to one of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> Prove therefore thy love to God, and that will ſtrengthen thy faith in God: for, as <hi>faith works by love,</hi> Gal 5.6. ſo the works of love do ſtrengthen faith. Faith as the occaſion of its exerciſe, and an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its being, but faith is not perfected in its eſſence and nature by Works, but by the Promiſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh and laſt Mean, is,<note place="margin">7. Experiences.</note> To ſtir up the manifold <hi>Experiences</hi> of Gods goodneſs and faithfulneſs to us for the time that is paſt: for this is a ſpecial Mean to ſtrengthen our faith for the time to come. Former Experiences may, and ought to build us up in future Confidences. If God hath delivered for the time paſt, and doth deliver for the preſent, we are bound the more firmly to believe, that <hi>he will yet deliver for that which is to come,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.9, 10. For when God <hi>fulfils with his hand, what he ſpeaks with his mouth,</hi> 1 King 8.15. ſuch a <hi>Providence</hi> being a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seal of his Promiſe, ought to confirm our Faith. For why? we know God is ſtill the ſame God, and changeth not; the Covenant is the ſame everlaſting Covenant; the Mediator of the Covenant is the ſame, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to day, and for ever:</hi> why ſhould not our faith be the ſame alſo, and more abundant? If a Chriſtian may ſay, God hath delivered, and doth deliver, and will yet deliver; why may he not alſo ſay, I have truſted in this God, and do truſt in him, and I will truſt in him for the time to come? Come what can come, I am reſolved to truſt in him. Job 13.15. <hi>Though he ſhould ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> I have ever found him a faithful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to me, and why ſhould not I continue a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:118867:313"/>
to him? His Word reports him to be a faithful God, and his Works alſo do ſpeak the ſame: I know this (may a gracious Soul ſay) by my own experience, and therefore <hi>they that know thy Name, will put their truſt in thee; for thou Lord haſt never failed them that ſeek thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. Be ſure therefore to keep a Catalogue of Gods merciful Providences, in anſwer to thy Prayers. This was <hi>Davids</hi> Cordial in a fainting Fit, <hi>I remember the years that are paſt,</hi> Pſal. 77.5. &amp; 143.5. It was that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him againſt the Philiſtim, when he remembred how God had took his part againſt the Lion and the Bear: 1 Sam. 17.37. <hi>The Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philiſtim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 'tis that, which may exceedingly ſtrengthen the faith of a poor creature, when it is able to ſay, I prayed to God at ſuch a time, and he heard me graciouſly; I was in a Soul-ſtraight, and he ſpake peace to my Soul; I had ſuch an enemy roſe up againſt me, and he <hi>changed his heart,</hi> that he would not hurt me; or he <hi>withered his hand,</hi> that he could not hurt me; I was in doubt, and he made my way plain before me; I was in woful perplexity, and he ſaid to my heart, <hi>Fear not;</hi> yea, I never ſought him in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but he was ever found of me in mercy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I ſhould now begin to diſtruſt this God, after all this experience, he may juſtly ſay to me, as one faithful friend ſays to another, when he begins to grow jealous or ſuſpicious, What, will you not take my word? did I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail you? was I ever falſe to you? what iniquity haſt thou or thy Fathers found in me, that thou ſhouldſt now begin to ſuſpect me? O (may God ſay to an experienced Chriſtian) of all men in the world, thou haſt the leaſt cauſe to ſtagger at the Promiſe: If thou doubteſt of the Word, yet at the leaſt, thou ſhouldſt <hi>believe me for the works ſake,</hi> Joh. 14.11.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee former experience may, and ought to
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:118867:313"/>
build up in future confidence. And theſe are the Means by which a weak Faith may be ſtrengthned. And ſo have we now diſpatch'd the firſt general Branch of the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative part of the Application <hi>relating to our ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Faith be our Life under God, then ſhould we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

And ſo it is with him that is weak and poor in the faith; he lives indeed by faith, but not ſo fully and comfortably as he that is rich in the faith: His Comforts are fewer, and his Fears are more.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things ſhould perſwade us to increaſe our faith.<note place="margin">Second Branch of Exhortation, Of Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to the Faith.</note> But we leave <hi>that</hi> Branch of <hi>Exhortation</hi> that concerns our <hi>ſelves,</hi> and come now to that which <hi>relates to others;</hi> and in concluding this, by Gods Aſſiſtance, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole ſubject of Faith.</p>
                  <p>For if Faith be ſuch an excellent Grace, (then, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good things, ſo alſo in this) the more <hi>common</hi> it is, the <hi>better</hi> it is. It is an excellent thing to be inſtrumental in the propagating the <hi>common Faith,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Look as a Father or Governour that lives comfortably upon his outward means himſelf, thinks himſelf bound in conſcience to maintain his Family, and to lay up for his Children, and ſo do good to the poor, that they may live the better by his means, as well as himſelf: So that man that lives by Faith himſelf, and findes the ſweetneſs of it,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:118867:314"/>
ſhould deſire to communicate this life to others, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour that they alſo may live by it as well as himſelf.</p>
                  <p>If the Life of Faith be ſuch an excellent Life, who would not labour to convert others to the Faith?</p>
                  <p>Me-thinks I hear God by his Spirit ſpeaking to the Soul of each faithful man, Behold, thou art converted thy ſelf, <hi>Haſt thou here any beſides</hi> (as the Angel ſaid to <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19 12.) <hi>Son in law, and thy ſons, and thy daughters,</hi> that are ſtill in <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſtill in the ſtate of Nature? O bring them out of this condition, that they may learn to live by Faith alſo, as well as thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is (indeed) the great Work of the Miniſters, and ought to be the endevour of every private Chriſtian in their private Admonitions and Exhortations, to convert others to the Faith.</p>
                  <p>Doſt thou deſire thy Children, thy Friends, thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours may live comfortably as well as thy ſelf, O labour to convert them to the Faith, and labour that they may live by Faith when they are converted. There's no Life under heaven to be compared with this Life.</p>
                  <p>But to preſs home farther and more effectually what I intend in this Point, I ſhall refer moſt of that I have to ſay, to that notable place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> which I ſhall adde as an Appendex to this Subject of Faith.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Here the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> foretelling the greateſt troubles that ever befel Gods People from the beginning of the World (which ſome underſtand of the great Perſecution under <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Epïphanes;</hi> and others of the laſt and great Perſecution under Antichriſt; and others underſtand it of <hi>both:</hi> and indeed, the firſt was a Type of the latter)
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:118867:315"/>
I ſay, the Prophet foretelling the greateſt troubles that ever befel Gods People, he foretels alſo (as was needful for their ſupport at ſuch a time) the greateſt comforts and encouragements that could be.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the very time of their troubles.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, in the iſſue and fruit of their troubles.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the time of their troubles: and that is, in the glorious appearance and aſſiſtance of the great General of the Field, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Angel of the Covenant, pleading the Cauſe, and fighting the Battels of his Servants. Here's the comfort; though there be no troubles like their troubles, yet there is no Saviour like their Saviour, ver. 1. <hi>And at that time ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great Prince, which ſtandeth for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thy people, and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in the iſſue and fruit of their troubles: As no troubles like their troubles, ſo no deliverance like their deliverance.</p>
            <p>Which is ſet forth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the glorious Reſurrection of all the faithful to life Eternal, in theſe words, <hi>viz.

            <p n="1">I. <hi>Branch.</hi> 'Tis an excellent Work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The turning of men unto Righteouſneſs, the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Souls to God, is the moſt excellent Work.</p>
            <p>It is an excellent Work indeed, by Prayer and other means to heal a ſick body: Jam. 5.15. <hi>The prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up.</hi> Yea,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:118867:316"/>
but it is a far more excellent Work to heal a ſick and ſinful Soul, ver. 19. <hi>Brethren, if any of you do erre from the truth, and one convert him, let him know, that he which converteth the ſinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall cover a multitude of ſins.</hi> This is an excellent Work indeed; and it is that excellent Work that was ſo much in <hi>Davids</hi> eye, he was marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous earneſt with God, to help him in the work of his own Converſion, or in the renewal of his Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and why ſo? that he might be the better fitted to convert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to God. Pſal. 51.13. <hi>Then will I teach tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee.</hi> This was the great and noble deſign of <hi>David,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Souls: He deſired, though he could not make God amends, yet to take a holy Revenge upon Satan, by drawing Subjects from him to God. And indeed, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a moſt excellent Work in many reſpects.</p>

Never did natural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents rejoyce more in their natural children, than Spiritual Parents do rejoyce in their Spiritual children. And if God would pleaſe ſo to bleſs my Labours this day, as to make me a poor Inſtrument of begetting one Soul to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, I ſhould think it an hour well ſpent: I ſhould have cauſe to bleſs God to all Eternity for this days work.

            <p>Look as thoſe men that were imployed in the Tabernacle in all <hi>cunning work</hi> of Silk, and Purple, and fine-twined Linen, of Silver and Gold and Precious Stones, they had a more honourable ſervice, than ſuch as were imployed in Goats-hair, in Rams-skins, and Badgers-skins: So ſuch as are imployed for the good of Souls, have a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſervice, than ſuch as are imployed for the good of mens Eſtates, Bodies, or Names. That's the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Work, that is imployed about the moſt excellent Object.</p>
            <p>What is the Body, or what is the outward Eſtate of a man, in compariſon of his Soul? Nay, what are all the <hi>goods</hi> in the world, to be laid in the Balance with the Soul? the whole Globe of the Earth, with all the glory of it (in compariſon of this) is lighter than vanity. He that well knew the worth of both, hath ſaid it, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> Mat. 16.26. And if the loſs of a Soul be ſo great a loſs, then the gain of a Soul muſt needs be as great a gain.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, the Salvation of Souls is the moſt excellent Work, becauſe it hath the moſt excellent Object.</p>

            <p>The Doctrine was this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The turning of men unto Righteouſneſs;</hi> or, <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Souls, as it is the moſt excellent Work, ſo it ſhall certainly be crowned with the moſt excellent Reward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what's the Reward? <hi>To ſhine as the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> And this proves it to be the moſt excellent Work: for God ſhall reward men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works; though not according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their work, yet (of his Free-grace) according to the nature of their works.</p>
            <p>Such is Gods method of Retribution, that as you may reade mens ſins in their puniſhment: ſo you may behold the excellency of the work in the glory of their Reward. As <hi>works of darkneſs</hi> ſhall be puniſhed in the place of <hi>utter darkneſs:</hi> ſo ſuch as have been (as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was) <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining lights</hi> in the work of the Miniſtery, they ſhall ſhine as the glorious <hi>lights of Heaven</hi> for ever and ever. They did ſhine as ſtars <hi>here,</hi> Rev. 1.20 &amp; 12.1. therefore they ſhall ſhine as ſtars <hi>hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O how ſhould the conſideration of this great Reward, quicken us up in the performance of the VVork (for to that end doubtleſs it is ſpoken.)</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we ſhould labour in the Converſion of Souls, were there no reward at all: how much more then, when it brings ſo great advantage every ways? not onely to the perſon converted, but to him alſo that is the Inſtrument of his Converſion? <hi>They ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O what a garland of Glory is put upon the Head of theſe Conquerours! Beloved, ſuch as conquer but a Kingdom or two, they think they gain much; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſo lifted up, they know not what ground they ſtand upon (though the VVord tells us, they are ſet in <hi>ſlippery places</hi>) But (how do you think) they would
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:118867:322"/>
glory, if they ſhould conquer all the world? And yet for my own part, if I could but conquer one Soul, and bring it home to Jeſus Chriſt, I ſhould think I had cauſe (in the ſtrength of God) to out-glory all ſuch men: one ſingle Soul (as we heard) being more worth than all the world: When all is done, Soul-Converters are the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors under Heaven. <hi>Thanks be to God, which always, and in every place, cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.14.</p>
            <p>He is the beſt Conqueror indeed, that brings the moſt Subjects unto Jeſus Chriſt, and he ſhall have the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: His head ſhall be compaſs'd with a Crown of Glory. And thus have we ſeen the Truth of this Doctrine, <hi>The turning of men, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>You read, Luk. 9.54. becauſe the Samaritans would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Jeſus Chriſt, preſently the Diſciples (<hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>) were <hi>fire and towe</hi> againſt them; nothing will ſerve their turn, but that <hi>fire</hi> muſt immediately <hi>come down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to conſume them: But in ſtead of incouragement, they meet with a check from Chriſt, ver. 55. <hi>But he turned and rebuked them, and ſaid, Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of; for the Son of Man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi>

               <p>Certainly, they are of ſtrange ſpirits, that would ſend men quick to Hell, becauſe they will not be perſwaded to go in their way to heaven. But this is the way to deſtroy Souls, and not to ſave them.</p>

In ſtead of drawing others <hi>to God,</hi> they drive them <hi>from God;</hi> and if they draw them any ways, they draw them farther into ſin: Such men as they, do the very office of the Devil himſelf.</p>
               <p>Look as thoſe that win Souls to God, are fellow-workers with God: ſo thoſe that deſtroy Souls, are no better than fellow-workers with the Devil; they are Tempters under him, and act the Devils part: Prov. 1.11. <hi>Come, ſay they, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

               <p>What? are your own ſins too light, that you do thus cry for more weight? not to eaſe your pain, but to increaſe it? for ſuch as are <hi>partakers</hi> of other mens <hi>ſins,</hi> ſhall certainly be <hi>partakers</hi> of other mens <hi>judgements,</hi> Rev. 18.4.</p>
               <p>Oh! that there ſhould be ſuch an itch in this Spiritual Plague-ſore, to infect others to make them as ſinful and as miſerable as themſelves.</p>
               <p>O hear, and fear and tremble, thou that makeſt it thy work to tempt others ſo ſin againſt God. For if they ſhall not eſcape, that have not furthered the Salvation of others, where ſhalt thou appear, that haſt furthered the damnation of others, and ſent them <hi>poſt</hi> to Hell? I ſay, where ſhalt thou appear, unleſs thou repent and be deeply humbled for this thy <hi>ſuperlative</hi> wickedneſs? And ſurely, if ever thou doſt repent, thou wilt be ready to admoniſh thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Drunkard, or Adulterer, or Blaſphemer, that they may become partners with thee in thy Repentance, that have been partners with thee in thy ſin.</p>
               <p>The penitent Thief upon the Croſs had but a little time to turn him in; and yet a good part of that little,<note place="margin">Note.</note> he ſpent in labouring to gain the Soul of his fellow-Thief: Luk. 23.40. <hi>Doſt not thou fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be aſſured of this, that as the gain of Souls is the beſt of all gains: So the blood of Souls, of all other blood, will lie the heavieſt upon the Conſcience of ſuch as are guilty of it.</p>

               <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>love</hi> of, and endevour after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Holineſs: 1 Joh. 3.3. <hi>Every one that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> We were redeemed, Luke 1.75. <hi>that we ſhould ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all our days.</hi>

               <p>Sixthly, By the <hi>Spirit of Prayer, and Supplication,</hi> and Adoption: Rom. 8.15. <hi>Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> None of Gods children are born tongue-ty'd.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, By our <hi>Love,</hi> or working of our love to a threefold object: for Gods People partake of Divine Nature. 2 Pet. 1.4. and this Divine Nature is diſcovered in nothing more than in a way of love, 1 Joh. 4.16.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To God</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt as our chief portion. Pſal. 119.57. <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord, I have ſaid that I would keep thy words:</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. <hi>

               <p>Therefore be thankful, that God ſhould vouchſafe to imploy any of us, in ſo honorable work and ſervice who deſerved not to waſh the feet of his ſervants. That God ſhould crown our poor weak indeavours with the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſouls.</p>

            <p>THus you ſee how ſuch as live by Faith themſelves, ſhould labour to convert others to the Faith. And thus have we done (through Gods grace aſſiſting) with this whole Subject of Faith, I have now but two Requeſts to make unto you by way of Concluſion: the one is, that I may obtain the help of your Prayers, that I may be enabled from God to hold forth by <hi>Pattern,</hi> what I have ſo long held forth by <hi>Precept</hi> in the Life of Faith, whatever Trials ſhould come.</p>
            <p>And the other is, That you would be perſwaded to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, in walking according to the Rule that hath been ſet before you; That what hath been ſpoken, may be preſt and imprinted upon your hearts by the Spirit of the living God.</p>
            <p>You have heard much of Faith in my Reverend Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors time, as appeareth by what is left upon Record; and God hath directed me to ſtrike upon the ſame Nail; I may ſay, as many years together, as I intended days at the firſt. But he that multiplied the <hi>barley loaves,</hi> and the <hi>broken meat,</hi> was pleaſed in the dividing and diſtributing of this Subject of Faith, to multiply my Meditations far beyond my firſt intentions</p>

               </gap> be the fruit of my poor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, That when I have done preaching of this Subject, you may ſo begin and continue to practiſe what hath been taught, that your life may be a living by Faith, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Commentary</hi> upon the Text.</p>
            <p>And Oh that I could perſwade you to live this Life of

            <p>But I beſeech you, be you Believers and <hi>doers</hi> of this <hi>word, and not hearers onely, deceiving your own ſelves.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1.</note> Elſe I ſhall have cauſe to complain, I have not ſtood long enough upon this Subject: For that is never ſufficiently taught, that is not ſufficiently learnt and put in practiſe.</p>
            <p>My hearts deſire and Prayer to God for <hi>Ipſwich</hi> is. That as they have heard much of Faith: ſo they might live by it as much; that whilſt our Neighbors look upon us, and <hi>mark our ſteps,</hi> they may not ſee in this Town, here a company living by Senſe; and there another living by Wits, Shifts and Projects; and a third living upon their Luſts; and a fourth upon their unrighteous Mammon; and a fifth upon their Self-righteouſneſs: and ſo the reſt. But we might ſo generally live by Faith (through the grace of
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:118867:334"/>
God) that I might have cauſe to glory of you, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth of the Romans, Chap. 1.8. <hi>I thank my God through Jeſus Chriſt, that your Faith is ſpoken of in all places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, in the mean time I bleſs God, that I have found ſome fruits of my weak endevours, in helping any to ſet their faces <hi>Sion</hi>-ward, who have acknowledged the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of the Spirit upon the <hi>waters;</hi> &amp; that <hi>God</hi> hath drawn out the <hi>deſire of their ſouls to the remembrance of his name.</hi> I have great cauſe to be confident, That where God hath <hi>begun</hi> this good work of Faith amongſt you, he will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it unto the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this good Word of Promiſe, I ſhall conclude my <hi>Preaching</hi> of this Subject, in that <hi>Prayer</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10, 11. <hi>Now the God of all grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Chriſt Jeſus, after that ye have ſuffered awhile, make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you. To him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
